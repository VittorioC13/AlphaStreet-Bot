[TITLE]UK and Norway to operate together to counter Russian undersea threat through major new defence agreement:
[TEXT]
UK critical infrastructure will be protected from Russian submarines through a first-of-its-kind defence agreement that will see British and Norwegian navies operating side-by-side in the North Atlantic.

The agreement comes as the Prime Minister welcomes Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Støre to visit RAF Lossiemouth today. During the visit, the leaders will meet UK and Norwegian troops working together and thank them for their service over the Christmas period.

The leaders will also hear firsthand from P-8 maritime patrol aircraft crews who have been tracking Russian vessels operating in UK waters - including the Russian intelligence ship Yantar, detected just weeks ago on the edge of UK waters north of Scotland.

The new Lunna House Agreement will see the Royal Navy and Royal Norwegian Navy operate an interchangeable fleet of British-built Type-26 frigates. It follows a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.

At the heart of the agreement is the new joint fleet of Type-26 anti-submarine warfare frigates – eight British and at least five Norwegian – backed by the biggest British warship deal in history. The £10 billion deal between the UK and Norway, signed in September, is a major boost to British shipbuilding and supports over 4,000 high-skilled British jobs.

Named after the Scottish headquarters of the Norwegian resistance during the Second World War – Lunna House in the Shetland Isles – the agreement builds on 75 years of UK-Norway cooperation – both founding NATO members.

It demonstrates the UK stepping up on European security and together with major agreements with Germany and France, shows how the Government is rebuilding close alliances essential for keeping Britain safe in an increasingly dangerous world.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

At this time of profound global instability, as more Russian ships are being detected in our waters, we must work with international partners to protect our national security. This historic agreement with Norway strengthens our ability to protect our borders and the critical infrastructure our nations depend on. Through joint navy cooperation in the North Atlantic, we’re boosting security, supporting thousands of UK jobs, and showcasing Britain’s world-class shipbuilding on the global stage.

Defence Secretary John Healey and his Norwegian counterpart Tore O. Sandvik are expected to sign the agreement at 10 Downing Street today. Following the signing, they will visit the Maritime Capability Coalition in Portsmouth – a jointly led initiative focused on delivering vital training, equipment, and infrastructure to bolster Ukraine’s maritime operations and strengthen its ability to operate at sea.

The powerful and advanced Type 26 warships will patrol the strategically vital gap between Greenland, Iceland and the UK, monitoring Russian naval activity and defending critical infrastructure such as underwater cables and pipelines, which carry vital communications, electricity and gas.

Both navies will operate as one – sharing maintenance facilities, technology and equipment to create truly interchangeable forces able to deploy rapidly wherever needed.

Defence Secretary John Healey MP said:

In this new era of threat and with increasing Russian activity in the North Atlantic, our strength comes from hard power and strong alliances. When our critical infrastructure and waters are threatened, we step up. For over 75 years, the UK and Norway have stood shoulder-to-shoulder on NATO’s northern flank, defending Europe and keeping our people safe. This partnership takes us further, making our nations more secure at home and strong abroad. Through this Lunna House Agreement, we will patrol the North Atlantic as one, train together in the Arctic, and develop the advanced equipment that will keep our citizens safe now and into the future. We are stepping up on European security and delivering on our NATO-first plan.

The agreement will also see:

UK joining Norwegian programme to develop motherships for uncrewed mine hunting and undersea warfare systems.

Year-round training of Royal Marines in Norway, preparing them to fight in sub-zero conditions.

Royal Navy adopting advanced Norwegian naval strike missiles.

Deeper collaboration on Sting Ray torpedoes, helping to boost munitions stockpiles.

Joint wargaming between our Armed Forces.

UK and Norway leading NATO’s adoption of autonomous systems in the High North.

The Lunna House agreement will also see deeper industrial collaboration between the UK and Norway, supporting skilled jobs while enhancing warfighting readiness.

The new agreement confirms that the UK will join Norway’s programme to develop innovative offshore support vessels, which will act as motherships for uncrewed mine hunting and undersea warfare systems.

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as weak ADP jobs data reinforces growing Fed rate cut bets:
[TEXT]
US stocks edged up on Wednesday as a surprise decline in private-sector employment revealed cracks in the job market, but also reinforced bets on a Fed rate cut next week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.9%, or over 400 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 0.2% after the major gauges finished Tuesday with gains across the board.

The ADP report looked to add fuel to the rate-cut fire, as nearly 90% of bets sit on a quarter-point reduction from the Federal Reserve next week. Private employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, compared with expectations for a modest gain. ADP said the decline was driven primarily by a sharp pullback from small businesses.

Meanwhile, from the Institute for Supply Management showed US services activity expanded slightly in November to a reading of 52.6%, while the index for prices paid eased to a seven-month low in a potentially positive sign for inflation. The next official update on consumer prices — the PCE print due Friday — is playing catch-up from September.

Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) extended its bid to bounce back from a deep, weeks-long slump that pulled the token below $83,000 in recent days. The leading cryptocurrency rose to a two-week high above $93,000 on Wednesday before retracing some of its gains.

Microsoft (MSFT) helped spur an early decline in tech stocks, and its shares ended down 2.5% after The Information reported that the software giant is lowering its AI sales quotas. That appeared to reignite investor skepticism around AI demand. Leading semiconductor stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) dropping, among others.

On the earnings front, Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock climbed nearly 8% after the US chipmaker's upbeat sales outlook and deal to buy Celestial AI. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) surged 15% after the retailer's strong start to the holiday shopping season.

Salesforce (CRM) results are on Wednesday's docket after the bell.

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq end little changed as Wall Street's Fed rate cut conviction runs high:
[TEXT]
US stocks closed mixed on Thursday as Wall Street digested fresh jobs data, with traders increasingly baking in expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver a December rate cut.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped almost 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up 0.2%. The moves came on the heels of small closing gains for Wall Street stocks.

Meta (META) led tech higher, with shares up over 3% as a report said CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned to make steep cuts to the company's metaverse unit. Nvidia (NVDA) also gained, rising over 2%.

Overall, Wall Street is under growing conviction that the Fed will shift toward easing at its policy meeting next week, fueled by support from key officials and a lackluster run of economic data. Traders are pricing in an 89% probability of a rate cut, per CME FedWatch, after a softer-than-expected ADP reading on private employment.

Speculation that Kevin Hassett will replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair is playing into longer-term expectations for lower rates. The White House's top economic advisor is seen as likely to usher in a more dovish era at the Fed, given his backer President Trump's aggressive campaign for rapid cuts. But markets are said to be doubtful about Hassett, and bond investors have reportedly voiced concerns to the US Treasury.

Further clues to the state of the labor market came Thursday, with jobless claims unexpectedly falling to a three-year low. But another report found that last month was the worst November for corporate layoffs in three years. On the inflation side, investors will on Friday get the September PCE reading on consumer prices — the Fed's preferred gauge.

Meanwhile, with earnings season in its final stretch, Salesforce (CRM) shares popped after the business software maker posted a raised outlook that both topped analyst expectations. Snowflake (SNOW) stock tumbled after the AI data cloud provider's revenue guidance fell short.

[TITLE]Marquis data breach impacts over 74 US banks, credit unions:
[TEXT]
Financial software provider Marquis Software Solutions is warning that it suffered a data breach that impacted dozens of banks and credit unions across the US.

Marquis Software Solutions provides data analytics, CRM tools, compliance reporting, and digital marketing services to over 700 banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders.

In data breach notifications filed with US Attorney General offices, Marquis says it suffered a ransomware attack on August 14, 2025, after its network was breached through its SonicWall firewall.

This allowed the hackers to steal "certain files from its systems" during the attack.

"The review determined that the files contained personal information received from certain business customers," reads a notification filed with Maine's AG office.

"The personal information potentially involved for Maine residents includes names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, Taxpayer Identification Numbers, financial account information without security or access codes, and dates of birth."

Marquis is now filing notifications on behalf of its customers, in some cases breaking down the number of people impacted per bank in a state. These notifications state that similar data was exposed in the attack for customers in other U.S. states.

According to notifications filed in Maine, Iowa, and Texas, over 400,000 customers have been impacted from the following 74 banks and credit unions.

1st Northern California Credit Union Abbott Laboratories Employees Credit Union Advantage Federal Credit Union Agriculture Federal Credit Union Alltrust Credit Union BayFirst National Bank Bellwether Community Credit Union C&N Bank Cape Cod Five Capital City Bank Group Central Virginia Federal Credit Union Clark County Credit Union Community 1st Credit Union Community Bancshares of Mississippi, Inc.

At this time, Marquis says that there is no evidence that data has been misused or published anywhere.

However, as previously reported by Comparitech, a now-deleted filing by Community 1st credit union claimed that Marquis paid a ransom, which is done to prevent the leaking and abuse of stolen data.

"Marquis paid a ransomware shortly after 08/14/25. On 10/27/25 C1st was notified that nonpublic personal information related to C1st members was included in the Marquis breach," reads the deleted notification seen by Comparitech.

While the company's data breach notifications state only that it has "taken steps to reduce the risk of this type of incident," a filing by CoVantage Credit Union with the New Hampshire AG shares further details

[TITLE]A Close Look at China’s Tech Playbook:
[TEXT]
China

Confronting and Competing with China

The Trump administration has identified global technological leadership as a core element of its “America First” strategy. Within days of assuming office in January 2025, President Trump issued an executive order calling for US artificial intelligence (AI) global dominance. Measures to realize the president’s call to action soon followed: a reduction in regulatory restrictions around AI development and diffusion, support for more fossil fuel and nuclear power generation, the launch of the “Stargate” AI infrastructure initiative, and a commitment to export the US AI tech stack. The White House has also issued additional executive orders to support digital assets and financial technology, as well as drone technology. More technology priorities are in the pipeline.

To compete effectively with China, however, Trump will require a more comprehensive and strategic approach. Chinese President Xi Jinping understands technology as “the cornerstone of a strong nation” and has created a soup-to-nuts innovation and technology playbook designed to realize his vision of China as the world’s “primary center for science and high ground for innovation.” His playbook is built on five core elements: investment, indigenization, insulation, integration, and internationalization. In each of these components, China is either following close on the heels of or leading the United States.

After decades in which China trailed well behind the United States in both government and private sector funding of research and development, it is now expected to surpass the United States in 2026. Xi’s 2025 budget called for an 8.3 percent increase in government spending on science and technology, including a growing percentage dedicated to basic science. As Xi noted in a 2018 speech: “Basic research is the fountainhead of the whole scientific system.” UCSD researcher Jimmy Goodrich argued in a recent China Considered podcast, “China is really almost at a breakout stage of investment in basic science. . . . They’re building twenty new national labs and scientific facilities across the country. . . . It’s like Xi Jinping has a fascination with Journey to the Center of the Earth and every other sci-fi book.”

In contrast, the Trump administration slashed its 2025 proposed research funding for the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and the Department of Energy by as much as 56 percent and seeks to cut funding for basic science from $45 billion to $30 billion.

By other metrics, China is already ahead of the United States: It provides 33 percent more contributions to papers in high-quality health sciences and natural-science journals, employs more researchers than the United States and European Union combined, is on track to award twice as many STEM PhDs as the United States, and surpassed the United States in the number of international patents filed in 2019—and the top filer globally was Huawei (see chart). And it continues to invest in its talent base through scores of programs to recruit top scientists from abroad, while the United States is hemorrhaging talent.

In March 2025, the journal Nature reported that of 1,600 scientists polled, 75 percent were considering leaving the United States. The Trump administration’s proposed $100,000 fee on US companies for each H-1B foreign-expert visa may well lead US companies to outsource R&D. A National Academy of Sciences paper further reported that during 2010–21, nearly 12,500 scientists of Chinese descent left the United States for China—more than half during Trump’s first term. And when those scientists leave, they assume leadership positions in the Chinese science-and-technology ecosystem: in 2023, more than 70 percent of university and national project heads in China were returnees.

Moreover, as Hoover scholar Amy Zegart has shown, China no longer has the same reliance on Western training for its top researchers. More than half of breakthrough AI company DeepSeek’s staff is entirely homegrown Chinese talent.

Bringing it home

A second priority for Xi Jinping is ensuring that innovation and the ecosystem supporting it are located inside China. As he said in a 2014 speech before members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering, “We cannot always decorate our tomorrows with others’ yesterdays. . . . Moreover, we cannot always trail behind others. We have no choice but to innovate independently.”

Xi’s most significant initiative to advance this objective is Made in China 2025 (MIC2025). The initiative called for 70 percent or more self-sufficiency by 2025 in core basic components and key basic materials in ten priority sectors, such as new materials, medical devices, and semiconductors, and a dominant position in global markets by 2049.

The Rhodium Group reported that Chinese firms took market share from foreign companies in every MIC2025 sector; Bloomberg further assessed that China had achieved global leadership in five technologies within MIC2025 sectors: high-speed rail, graphene, unmanned aerial vehicles, solar panels, and electric vehicles and lithium batteries, while closing the gap in seven others. And as the MIT Technology Review reveals, the gap between China and the United States in these technologies is widening annually. China’s installed solar capacity dwarfs US capacity (see chart). And the same increasingly holds true for other clean-energy technologies, including wind turbines, electric vehicles, and lithium batteries. More than half the cars sold in China are now electric, and Chinese car companies represent two-thirds of global electric car sales.

Closely linked to indigenization is a commitment to insulate Chinese technologies from foreign competition. In pursuing MIC2025, for example, Beijing used an array of market and non-market barriers to help homegrown technologies. For example, MIC2025 required top Chinese hospitals to use 50 percent more domestically produced medical devices by 2020 and 95 percent more by 2030. Methods to realize these goals varied by province: Sichuan forced hospitals to use domestically produced medical devices in fifteen categories or insurance reimbursement would be withheld, while Ningxia required hospitals to justify any foreign medical-device import with an audit. Beijing has continued to reinforce its strategy through additional financial support, procurement policies, regulatory standards, and localization requirements for foreign firms to increase the share of high-end domestically produced medical devices. The objective is a fully homegrown medical device ecosystem from “raw materials to finished goods.”

A similar pattern is emerging in artificial intelligence. Beijing is sharply limiting opportunities for foreign chip companies: it has banned its major technology companies from buying AI chips from Nvidia, instructed Chinese automakers to “avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible,” required municipal state-owned enterprises to use Chinese-made semiconductors and computing infrastructure by 2027, and mandated that state-owned firms submit quarterly reports tracking their replacement of foreign software with Chinese alternatives.

Chinese skill

The fourth element of Xi’s playbook is the integration of civilian and military R&D via a military-civil fusion program. Although the program was established only in 2017, the practice predates its formal establishment. Huawei, for example, has collaborated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) since the company’s founding in 1987. Major technology companies will often possess a military-civil fusion department or office whose job it is to facilitate the transfer of commercial technology to the PLA and to signal to companies the technology needs of the military. Alibaba, for example, formed a joint venture with China’s most important state-owned arms designer and manufacturer, Norinco, on a satellite positioning service; Baidu opened a joint laboratory with China Electronics Technology Group, which serves as a critical supplier of advanced electronic systems and components to the Chinese military; and iFlyTek, one of the country’s “AI champions,” has a comprehensive relationship with the PLA and the country’s domestic security apparatus. These direct linkages make for a far more seamless adoption of cutting-edge technologies by the PLA and provide a potential path for sensitive foreign technologies to be surreptitiously exploited by the PLA via a commercial partner.

While Xi is committed to China reducing its reliance on the outside world for core components and materials, he is equally committed to ensuring that the rest of the world relies on Chinese technology. Xi has publicly identified technology as the “main battlefield” in the superpower rivalry and placed a premium on exporting China’s technology stack globally.

Domestically, China leads the world in the scaling and deployment of many technologies, including digital payments, high-speed rail, renewable energy and electric vehicles, e-commerce, and 5G, among others. But it also wants China to be the world’s technology partner of choice. China is investing heavily in global tech infrastructure and in setting global technology standards. Through the Digital Silk Road and Green Silk Road, offshoots of the 2013 Belt and Road initiative, China has become the largest exporter of clean technology globally, and Chinese companies such as Huawei, Alibaba, and State Grid have reportedly invested, loaned, or contracted over $30 billion in overseas telecommunications infrastructure, cloud services, digital payment systems, and satellite navigation platforms to more than 150 Belt and Road countries. China’s BeiDou satellite navigation system now covers 200-plus countries and regions, and more than 130 countries rely primarily on BeiDou rather than GPS for positioning services.

China also seeks to gain advantage for its global technology stack through setting technical standards in international bodies. China now holds top technical leadership posts in the United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and Chinese firms, such as Huawei and ZTE, are among the most active participants in study groups, working parties, and patents. While many of their proposals are designed to secure global markets, some, such as Huawei’s new IP, are designed to enhance state surveillance and control.

A time for new thinking

After more than a decade of implementing Xi Jinping’s innovation playbook, China is in the midst of a technological great leap forward. As UCSD researcher Jimmy Goodrich has noted, “The story of China twenty years ago stealing and replicating technology is really the story of yesterday. We’re looking at a China that is fundamentally changed. . . . So, we have to think

[TITLE]China’s Rise in Semiconductors Alarms the West - Global Research:
[TEXT]
China has successfully developed its semiconductor industry through state policy and now has a market share in the sector that worries the United States and its European allies. However, Western efforts to control the semiconductor sector are harming the entire world, from creating chaos in Latin America to attempting to draw industry from supposedly allied Taiwan.

The supply of semiconductors to the Brazilian automotive industry has been on the verge of collapse because 40% of chips come from Nexperia, a subsidiary of the Chinese semiconductor company Wingtech, based in the Netherlands. In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, citing national security concerns, and ordered the removal of the company’s CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, from his post. In response, the Chinese subsidiary announced the suspension of shipments of raw materials to its European counterpart, creating a global logistics bottleneck.

However, in November, Amsterdam announced the suspension of its intervention in the company following talks with Beijing, demonstrating Europe’s incapacity to challenge China in the semiconductor industry.

Nexperia is a crucial supplier of basic chips for the automotive industry, and the shortage of these components is threatening the global supply chain. Amid the crisis, China has assured that shipments to Brazil are guaranteed, but this is yet another indication of the central role of chips and semiconductors in current geopolitics, where the West, particularly the US, is losing its leadership in this technology.

The US was once at the forefront of semiconductors and pioneered their widespread use in computing and across society. But they have fallen a bit behind, and now they are trying to catch up on these efforts to attract all their human resources.

On the other side of the world, China took the opposite path. Since the 1980s, Beijing has recognized semiconductors as a crucial sector for development and has made it a national priority. China has managed to establish itself worldwide and has an industry comparable to, compatible with, and competitive with that of the US, which greatly worries countries linked to the North American country.

With people’s entire lives stored in the cloud and almost all analog components replaced by digital ones, it is hard to imagine an industry that would not be severely affected by a shortage of these products. Today, there are markets where you would not imagine using chips, but they have surprisingly been incorporated into these. Nowadays, semiconductors are in everything, and when they are not, ways are found to incorporate them, even if it seems unnecessary, such as in coffee makers and toasters.

Previously, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick proposed transferring 50% of the chips produced for export to the US from Taiwanese factories to new plants on American soil — a measure rejected by Taiwan’s Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun on October 2.

Responding to US demands directly, Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council, said that

“Taiwan’s most competitive sectors should be developing steadily, but now they are confused and acting hastily.”

According to the spokesperson, the initiative reflects the “America First” principle followed by Washington and demonstrates the fragility of the alleged “best phase of relations” between the US and Taiwan, proclaimed by the previous Biden administration.

“The island authorities’ constant compromises will only lead the United States to increase pressure and exploit their weaknesses,” Chen warned.

According to him, the microchip industry — Taiwan’s most competitive sector — is being transformed into a vulnerable point under American influence.

Chen also accused the Taipei government of “betraying Taiwan’s interests” by seeking external support.

“The root of the problem lies in the Democratic Progressive Party administration’s attempt to seek independence based on external forces, demonstrating submission to the US and betraying Taiwan’s interests,” he declared.

Taiwan is one of the world’s largest semiconductor producers, essential to automobiles, smartphones, and military equipment. TSMC, the leading company in the sector, became the global revenue leader in 2024, surpassing Intel and Samsung Electronics.

With these constant Western provocations, there is now concern

Qatar and Saudi Arabia are investing in new terrestrial cable systems to relieve the strain on underwater cables in the Red Sea. This is part of a fundamental modernization strategy.

Ooredoo, a Qatar-based communications company, plans to spend $500 million (€430 million) on new terrestrial fiber optic cable systems in the coming years. The cables will stretch from the Arabian Peninsula to Europe. According to a report by the Qatari news agency QNA, they will start in Oman, run from there to Iraq and Turkey and finally to France.

Notwithstanding, according to press reports, Syria and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to build a similar system of data cables that would also run from the Arabian Peninsula — more precisely, Saudi Arabia — to Europe.

Ayad Al-Ani, a Professor for Change Management and Consulting in Berlin, told DW that it was noteworthy that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were attempting to establish a land connection.

"This implies that both Iraq and Syria are safe transit countries that can be invested in," he said. "It will integrate the two countries more into the international data communication system, from which the local digital economy will benefit. This is likely to promote their economic development."

Alternative routes to bypass Red Sea challenges

According to QNA, Aziz Al Uthman Fakhroo, CEO of Ooredoo, suggested at a conference in Doha that the system would "strengthen the resilience of global networks, create alternative routes that bypass current challenges in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz."

From the perspective of network operators, both sea regions are considered risky. The Strait of Hormuz separates Iran from the Arabian Peninsula and, therefore, from countries with which Tehran has had a fierce rivalry, namely Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Iran has had several confrontations with Saudi Arabia in particular in the Straight of Hormuz. Qatar, meanwhile, maintains good relations with Iran.

The situation in the Red Sea is more fragile. Every year, 22,000 ships pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. It's also a main route in the digital network: There are currently 15 intercontinental undersea cables running through the area, and according to HGC Global Communications, 80% of data traffic between Asia, Africa and Europe runs through them.

The cables have repeatedly been the target of attacks — or might have been, because there is not always clear evidence of damage having been caused deliberately.

There were several outages in 2008 when, according to a study by the Henry Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington, five cables were damaged in different incidents. Three of the cables connected Asia and Europe, and as a result 70% of Egypt's internet connectivity was temporarily lost, while India experienced a 50% to 60% loss of bandwidth.

Houthi attacks on shipping routes and cable systems

In the recent war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas in Gaza, the latter received support from the Houthi rebel group in Yemen. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the EU, the US and others.

Houthis attacked hundreds of ships in the Red Sea to disrupt international trade. According to HGC, the group also damaged four cable systems in the spring of 2024, including the Asia-Africa-Europe 1 cable, which connects the three continents. A good quarter of data traffic was reportedly affected.

In a statement, HGC described how it was maintaining international communication by rerouting data traffic to Europe via mainland China, the US or undamaged cables in the Red Sea.

The idea is that the new systems will prevent such incidents. According to the QNA report, Aziz Al Uthman Fakhroo of Ooredoo said that "cross-border cooperation has become both an operational and strategic necessity, especially given that the Middle East is a global logistical and digital hub, with 30% of the world's data and 90% of the data exchanged between Europe and Asia passing through it."

Qatar expands telecommunications sector

Qatar is systematically expanding its telecommunications industry. Last fall, Qatar National Broadband Network (QNBN) and Gulf Bridge International (GBI) announced their intention to merge their telecommunications divisions. This merger has now been completed. QNBN specializes in fiber optic cables, while GBI focuses on underwater and terrestrial cables.

The Peninsula, an English-language daily in Qatar, reported that the "integration of QNBN and GBI brings together two highly complementary businesses to create a carrier-neutral digital and AI infrastructure leader, further connecting Qatar to the world."

Ayad Al-Ani pointed out that the projects were not focused only on infrastructure but also on Qatari digital technology, such as data centers.

"The infrastructure alone is already considered a significant source of revenue today. But in conjunction with data and innovation centers, it provides the prerequisites for a successful digital economy," he told DW.

According to GBI, Qatar is currently trying to attract innovative AI companies from Europe and Asia and to offer a "seamless gateway to interconnect within the Middle East region," the Gulf Times reported in October 2024. "The combined company will focus on maximizing opportunities within the international data traffic market," the Qatar-based English-language newspaper continued. "By leveraging its combined resources and expertise, the company aims to position itself as a key player…, driving innovation and expanding its presence globally to meet increasing demand for data connectivity across borders."

Ayad Al-Ani said that Qatar, like Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, was also looking to the post-fossil fuel era by creating these systems.

"The region also has almost unlimited solar energy, which is relatively inexpensive, for operating data centers," he said. "This is a significant advantage in this energy-intensive industry. No additional nuclear power plants are needed, as is the case in the US, for example."

[TITLE]EIB launches Space TechEU finance program for European space sector:
[TEXT]
EIB launches Space TechEU finance program for European space sector

by Robert Schreiber

Berlin, Germany (SPX) Dec 03, 2025

The European Investment Bank (EIB) has launched Space TechEU, its first financing programme dedicated to companies in Europe's space sector, under its wider TechEU initiative. The bank presented the facility at the European Space Agency (ESA) Council of Ministers meeting in Bremen.

Space TechEU will provide up to 500 million euro in EIB financing to companies across the space value chain, from upstream manufacturing and launch activities to downstream applications and services. By working with commercial banks, the programme aims to mobilise around 1.4 billion euro in total investment and targets small and medium-sized enterprises and mid-cap firms that face difficulties accessing bank finance.

Under the scheme, the EIB will extend credit lines and guarantees to banking partners in EU Member States. ESA will support participating banks by contributing sector expertise and technical assessment capabilities through a strategic partnership with the EIB.

"Through this new dedicated space finance programme, we will give banks across the EU the tools and the confidence to increase their financing for space companies in Europe across the entire space value chain", EIB Vice President Robert de Groot said. "We are supporting the development of a strong, globally competitive European space industry - one that ensures more autonomy and contributes to our prosperity and security."

Space TechEU builds on a tripartite partnership agreed in 2024 between the EIB Group, ESA and the European Commission that seeks to improve access to finance for space companies, stimulate innovation and knowledge exchange, and accelerate the development of new space technologies by combining institutional expertise. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher, European Commissioner Andrius Kubilius and representatives of three major European commercial banks outlined the role of Space TechEU in increasing space investment through tailored financing during the launch event.

The EIB and ESA plan to use Space TechEU to address financing gaps for SMEs and mid-caps in space and related space-enabler industries, where many banks have limited familiarity with sector-specific risks and business models. The programme will provide technical support, strengthen market understanding among lenders and promote the facility to companies that make limited use of commercial bank financing.

Space TechEU is designed to complement existing European Commission space programmes by aligning additional financing with Europe's strategic priorities. Eligible investments cover satellite and rocket design, manufacturing and launch, ground infrastructure, enabling technologies and data-driven applications in fields such as telecommunications, maritime navigation, agriculture, climate and resource management, with other space-related activities also potentially in scope.
