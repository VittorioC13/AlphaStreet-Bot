[TITLE]Google argues a forced sale of Ad Exchange is too risky:
[TEXT]
Google has spent the past week in Virginia federal court seeking to persuade a judge that selling off its advertising exchange is too risky, technologically difficult and would disrupt the market.

Over the past five days, witnesses testifying on Google’s behalf said that a forced sale would upset a business worth $15.9 billion in revenue, according to U.S. estimates for 2025 by research firm Emarketer, create ripples of uncertainty across the market, degrade service for the smallest online publishers and scare away potential buyers.

The trial is focused on how to restore competition to the technology that underpins the display advertising business controlled by Google after Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled in April that the company had an illegal monopoly in two markets — the advertising exchange and publisher-side technology, known as an ad server.

Google also offers ad-buying tools for advertisers in addition to ad-selling ones for website publishers and a trading exchange where both sides complete transactions in lightning-fast auctions.

To remedy the illegal conduct, the Justice Department has proposed that Google be forced to sell off the exchange, AdX, and make public the logic behind how the ad server decides which advertisement to show. If those changes don’t resolve competition issues in the market, the Justice Department has requested that Google also be forced to sell off its ad server over time.

Google has countered with a proposal to integrate its technology with a popular alternative, known as Prebid, as well as with rival ad servers. It’s also pledged not to re-enable certain auction mechanics the court found gave it illegal advantages, known as “first look” and “last look.”

But the company has spent most of its time defending against the Justice Department’s proposal that it be forced to sell off AdX — which according to the agency’s estimates controls

[TITLE]Conservative Party pledges £1.6bn ICE-style 'removals force' to deport 150,000 illegal migrants a year:
[TEXT]
The Conservatives are pledging to create a new "removals force" to detain and remove 150,000 a year as part of a broad plan to tackle illegal immigration to the UK.

Modelled on the "successful approach" of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, this new force would be given "sweeping new powers", and over £1bn in funding.

The pledge is part of the Conservative Party's broad new plans to stop illegal migration to the UK, set to be unveiled by Kemi Badenoch on the first day of their annual conference on Sunday, where reducing immigration and creating "Strong Borders" will be one of the key themes.

Speaking to Sky News' Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips ahead of her speech, shadow home secretary Chris Philp insisted this is a "detailed and comprehensive plan to get control of this country's borders".

However, Ms Badenoch did not provide specifics when asked on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg where migrants being removed would go, claiming that question was "irrelevant".

She said: "I'm tired of all of these irrelevant questions

[TITLE]AI workflows - RecordPoint: Accelerating AIOps with integrated data risk management:
[TEXT]
This is guest post for the Computer Weekly Developer Network written by Anthony Woodward in his capacity as co-founder and CEO of RecordPoint.

The company is known for its cloud-based software that helps regulated businesses discover, govern and control data and records for compliance and risk reduction.

The platform classifies data, applies retention schedules and provides audit trails for data from creation to disposal. It integrates with other systems to create an inventory of all organisational data.

Woodward writes in full as follows…

It’s 2025 and it’s no longer a question of whether AI belongs in your developers’ toolkit, but where and how much of their process will be AI-driven.

Enter AIOps, the practice of integrating AI capabilities directly into developers’ and IT professionals’ daily workflows. In embedding AI directly into processes, AIOps allows teams to save time and effort and increase productivity.

There’s just one catch: a rapid embrace of AIOps, without considering the data that powers it exposes organisations to risk. In the quest to optimise developer performance, data risk management can lag behind, creating blind spots. The result is increased regulatory, security and operational risk.

Current challenges facing AIOps teams include the fact that developer teams seeking to implement AIOps face a host of problems, most of which are familiar from a pre-AI age.

Fragmented data ecosystems Most enterprises run hybrid architectures: multiple clouds, on‑prem systems and dozens of SaaS apps. These structured and unstructured data sources each have different defaults for data collection, storage and retention. Today, many SaaS tools will now ship with their own LLMs/agents, creating AI silos without centralised oversight. Then there’s dark data, the data you don’t know you have, but are still responsible for. Unclassified, unmonitored and over-retained data increases exposure and can make its way into an AI model, potentially leading to substandard or noncompliant output. A subcategory of dark data is ROT, redundant, obsolete and trivial data clogging up your systems. Organisations are facing evolving regulatory requirements, from the familiar – GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and industry-specific rules – to the AI-specific standards: the NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001 and the EU AI Act.

DevOps/AIOps bottlenecks When you can’t be sure you understand your data and you have an increasing collection of regulatory standards to meet, you wind up with security and compliance checks that slow down developer velocity without automation. Or worse yet, you don’t have any checks… and the risk continues to build in the background. So then, let’s get to the case for integrated data risk management in AIOps. By treating operations and governance as separate issues, you increase risk and slow delivery. Developer velocity may increase, but the overall production process won’t: these security or compliance checks need to happen or you risk a data leak or a fine. Say goodbye to after‑the‑fact checks and audits, emergency meetings and waiting for compliance sign-off and instead, usher in continuous classification, retention enforcement and contextual risk scoring, which will raise early warnings, prioritise action and create auditable trails in real time. By establishing a data risk management system up-front and setting policies ahead of time, you will avoid the need to solve these problems in the heat of development, leading to slower deployment and potentially inconsistent policies. Tools like Sonar Cloud allow you to move the compliance and risk management stage all the way left, into your CI/CD process to, for example, block a code merge if it would be against a policy. That’s

[TITLE]Europe FDI Trends Report 2025: EU-US Trade Agreement Ensures 15% Tariff, Eases Threat of Escalation:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "FDI Trends in Europe (2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Europe experienced a robust growth phase characterized by increased project numbers and capital expenditures from 2023 to 2024, . Europe's share in opened Greenfield Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) projects, dominated by Western Europe, rose to 40% in 2024. Despite visible FDI opportunity, Eurozone GDP growth stunted at 0.9% in 2024, with structural issues like low productivity, rapidly increasing bond yields, and energy costs weighing on industrial competitiveness

Despite healthy levels of inward Greenfield FDI recorded in 2024, Europe's FDI climate is facing the brunt of US levies, weak macroeconomic performance, and prolonged war; these headwinds are explanatory for why opened projects in Europe declined by 44% YoY in H1 2025. Evidently, projects are stalling and/or relocating while investors seek clarity on the new global trade status quo.

To-date:

The EU faces an "all inclusive" 15% tariff rate as part of an EU-US trade agreement signed on July 27th, 2025. The deal effectively halved previously threatened rates (up to 30%) and prevented further escalation. However, copper, steel and aluminum levels remain at 50%.

As part of a US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal, the UK is subject to a baseline 10% tariff rate, made effective April 5th 2025. Still, goods such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, steel and aluminium are subject to variable higher rates.

Switzerland has been hit with a 39% tariff rate to curtail exports of luxury goods to the US.

The ability of Ursula von der Leyen-President of the European Commission-and Europe more broadly to retaliate is somewhat hamstrung by the region's dependence on US investment. Europe, unlike emerging economies, is notably less dependent on inward FDI flows with strong intracontinental trade. Still, the US is Europe's largest greenfield investor, announcing 954 projects (2023-H1 2025), trailed by China with 140 over the same time frame.

In terms of announced projects, Europe's distribution of inward FDI is relatively equitable among the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Turkiye and Poland. Furthermore, 40% of incoming projects (announced 2020-2024) are in renewable and alternative power, as the UK rejoins the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the US pivots back toward petrochemical energy.

Moving forward, The analyst's FDI team expects current sectoral trends to escalate, whereby international investment in renewable energy becomes more European-centric. Nations across the UK, EU and Schengen area all boast high-skilled labor, a unified regulatory framework, and attractive green credit incentives. However, whether announced investments translate into opened projects and Europe yields the benefits of renewable energy development depends on whether macroeconomic outlooks ameliorate. Strong institutional frameworks will aid development, but without attractive financial incentives and supportive macroeconomic conditions, projects will continue to stall and international investors will look elsewhere.

[TITLE]Vodafone Ireland’s new Italian boss Sabrina Casalta: ‘Being a CEO was actually not in my plan’:
[TEXT]
Sabrina Casalta works well under pressure. And the new Vodafone Ireland chief has had plenty of it to test her, whether it is in the executive boardroom or on one of her road trips that turn out to be a little more challenging than you would expect.

Casalta says she likes to be forced out of her comfort zone and, with travel, there is always the potential for things to go wrong. A recent 300km trip in Mozambique threw up some interesting obstacles. “It took 12 hours. The road was foggy, there were points where you couldn’t see two metres ahead. The road was ruined by massive holes from the civil war, and there were lots of people and students walking to school on the side of the road,” she recalls. “I was responsible for making the plans. And I was the one driving for the 12 hours.”

The move from Vodafone Italy in the wake of its €8 billion sale to Swisscom to head the Irish business is her latest challenge.

“Being a CEO was actually not in my plan,” she says. “I don’t think there is the ‘final job’. It’s a journey.”

Caslta’s career is not what you would describe as linear.

“I’m not a vertical expert in one area or another. I went through different experiences and I think they were all built around curiosity, and adding pieces and tools to my skills in order to always have a broader impact.”

After graduating with a masters in management engineering, Casalta began working as a consultant, first with PricewaterhouseCoopers (now PwC), and subsequently with Boston Consulting Group. That involved working across multiple industries, focusing mainly on strategy and business transformation but not in financial services and telecoms.

Then, 14 years ago, she took up a role with Vodafone.

“When I got the chance to join Vodafone, I said, why not? It’s a new area, something new to learn and to understand.”

“Why not” seems to be what drives her. After joining Vodafone Italy in a strategy role, she moved on to become an integral part of its fibre services launch, and the early days of its 5G trials. “We started with the very early trial and experimentation into 5G, some of them even before the standard of the technology was completely defined,” she says.

Her most significant experience, she says, came later when she joined Vodafone’s business customer care team, just as the Covid-19 lockdowns began in Northern Italy. Again, “why not?” came into play.

“It was quite a big change for me, coming from strategy perspective. I completely changed my time horizon. When you work on strategy, you work on three, five years perspective; in customer operations, you have to deliver consistently, every single hour, every single day, across team of hundreds of people,” she says. “I think that the learning was on the execution side, but most importantly on the people management side.”

In February 2022, she became chief financial officer of the business, staying in the role for almost three years until the business was sold. That was when the ambition to take on a chief executive role kicked in.

“I realised that all the experience I had, they all made sense together because they gave me the broader perspective

[TITLE]The “Invisible Hand” and fake invoices, the ministers’ surprise about Kövesi, Paulson and UBS, what Goldman Sachs was doing with Mylonas, the Belgians looking into Eurobank:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 2 09:43

Hello, I’d like to start today with the success of the “Greek FBI” in uncovering yet another major case involving forged and fake invoices, where various schemers try to steal VAT — in other words, public funds. In recent years, both the Greek Police services and, more importantly, the Anti–Money Laundering Authority and the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE) have admittedly “caught” many such or similar cases. In these cases, we often hear — because they are included in the official reports of the Authorities and sent to the prosecutor — various well-known names: artists, celebrities, football figures, and so on. The problem is that in Greece, “miracles” seem to last only a few days, just long enough to make media noise. Afterwards, everything is forgotten, and the main figures in these major fraud cases walk away unscathed (or almost unscathed) and carry on with their lives — often repeating the same or very similar financial crimes. It’s as if some “invisible hand” intervenes and magically erases or neatly covers everything up. So I want to ask publicly: who is this “invisible hand” that ultimately untangles all the messes for the country’s pseudo-celebrities, even if they’re being pursued by [Minister] Chrysochoidis, [prosecutor] Vourliotis, or [AADE head] Pitsilis? Is it one person, or a combination of entanglement, corruption, and public relations?

Kövesi – A Surprise Visit

Yesterday, European Chief Prosecutor Laura Kövesi was in Athens, where she met with Ministers Pierrakakis, Chrysochoidis, and Floridis. I spoke with all my sources, and they all told me almost exactly the same thing — with minor variations —

[TITLE]The War Over Defense Tech | Susannah Glickman:
[TEXT]
1.

Last October, on a Martin Luther–inspired website called www.18theses.com, a software executive named Shyam Sankar published a four-thousand-word polemic with the title “The Defense Reformation.” “As a nation, we are in an undeclared state of emergency,” it begins. There follows a litany of provocations: Chinese escalation in the South China Sea, Iranian attacks on US military bases, the October 7 attacks in Israel, “an estimated 1 million casualties in brutal combat in Ukraine.” All this, Sankar writes, amounts to “a hot Cold War II.”

It is a war, he argues, for which the US is catastrophically underprepared: “In the current environment, American industries can’t produce a minimum line of ships, subs, munitions, aircraft, and more.” The problem lies with American capitalism in its present form, which—as Sankar lamented last year on a military podcast called The Merge—has left legacy defense firms like Lockheed Martin dominated by “fifth-generation MBA cadre[s]” who care more “
