Does enCore Energy Corp. (EU) Make a Good Investment Amid a Renewed Interest in Nuclear?

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of uranium resource properties in the United States.

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) extracted 203,798 pounds of uranium in the second quarter of 2025, up by a significant 79% from Q1. These numbers are expected to pump after the company announced the acquisition of a 5,900 acre parcel of private land located immediately adjacent to its Alta Mesa uranium project in Texas.

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) also received a significant boost recently after it was reported that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has dismissed a review petition against permits for its Dewey Burdock uranium project. enCore said the project remains on a federal fast-track permitting program.

Following a resurgence of the American nuclear energy sector under the Trump administration and the recent increase in the price of uranium, the stock of enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) has surged by more than 180% over the last six months.

[TITLE]Greenland’s leader urges EU to invest in its mineral resources and renewable energy:
[TEXT]
BRUSSELS (AP) — Greenland’s leader on Wednesday thanked the European Union for being “a trusted friend” and urged the 27-nation bloc to invest in his country’s mineral resources, renewable energy, airports and internet services.

In a speech to the European Parliament, Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that “2025 has been an eventful if not dramatic year for Greenland.” He noted the challenge posed by climate change but did not mention President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing the Arctic island.

“We need cooperation and partnerships with like-minded countries and institutions who share our values. The EU has been a stable, reliable and important partner for Greenland for more than 40 years,” the 34-year-old premier said in Strasbourg, France.

He extended “a heartfelt thank you” to the EU “for your strong support for Greenland during challenging times we are going through right now. You have stood by us as a friend and partner. We will never forget this.”

Greenland was a colony under Denmark’s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later, Greenland became a self-governing entity. It remains part of the Danish realm.

Denmark, which also currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, and Greenland have rejected Trump’s offers to buy the island. He hasn’t ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich territory.

When asked by a reporter before his speech about relations with the Trump administration, Nielsen said that U.S.-Greenland ties should be managed “in mutual respect, with respect for international law.”

“We seek to have more and better cooperation also with the U.S.A., when we can fulfill the respectful tone,” he said.

During the speech, Nielsen said that Greenland has most of the critical raw minerals that the EU is seeking, but that mining these resources is “capital intensive.” He also urged the bloc to invest in the untapped hydroelectricity potential provided by the island’s rivers and glaciers.

Nielsen also called for financial support to develop telecommunications networks, particularly in the poorly connected north, and to build two regional airports.

“It is essential for us that those who operate telecommunications in Greenland are trusted and reliable actors. This is vital to ensure the stability of the infrastructure, and to prevent unauthorized parties from disrupting and compromising connections,” he said.

Lawmakers gave Nielsen a standing ovation as he said “thank you for being a trusted friend of Greenland.”

[TITLE]The Space Solar Power Revolution Is Well Underway:
[TEXT]
Energy companies are exploring alternative ways to access less conventional clean energy sources in a bid to support a global green transition and accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels. One of the energy sources being explored it space solar power. Scientists have discussed the potential for beaming solar power from space for decades, but until now it seemed like a pipedream. However, thanks to technological innovations, it may soon be possible.

According to a recent study, putting solar panels in space could reduce Europe’s terrestrial renewable energy needs by 80 percent by 2050. The study used a detailed computer model of Europe’s future power grid to assess the potential for a network of space-based panels to deliver clean energy to the region. The panels, designed by Nasa, could significantly reduce the cost of Europe’s power network, by up to 15 percent, it found. It would also reduce our reliance on battery storage to make the solar power supply more stable.

The King’s College London-led study looks at the use of space-based solar power (SBSP) system, which uses mirror-like reflectors to collect sunlight in orbit to transmit sunlight to specially designed stations on Earth before converting it into electricity to deliver to the grid. The computer assesses the delivery of power to a European transmission network spanning 33 countries. The researchers found that SBSP could be used to replace as much as 80 percent of the region’s land-based renewable energy to provide a more reliable source of clean power.

While the modelling does not account for certain challenges that may be encountered by generating solar power in space, including orbital congestion, transmission interruptions, and beaming variability, it provides significant hope for the future of clean energy delivery.

One of the main barriers to the rollout of the technology is the initial set-up costs involved with launching such complex, large-scale solar space project. The SBSP project assessed in the study would not be cost-effective until around the mid-century due to the building, launching and maintenance costs involved at present.

There are additional risks that must be assessed before any SBSP can be developed. King’s College professor Wei He said, “There are some risks to consider, such as how the satellite in space could have too many solar panels. Could it cause collisions or be damaged by debris in space?” However, SBSP technology shows significant promise for the future of clean energy and decarbonisation if those risks can be mitigated.

SBSP projects are already being developed in some parts of the world, such as Japan, which views the technology as key to achieving a green transition. The Japanese government will support the launch of giant solar panels measuring 2 km2 into space to produce clean electricity using solar energy. The satellites are expected to be capable of generating power 24 hours a day, regardless of the weather and will produce an estimated five to 10 times more power than ground-based solar panels. Each satellite is expected to produce 1 million kW of electricity, equivalent to the output of a nuclear power plant. The microwaves used by the system can also penetrate clouds and rain to provide optimum power delivery.

Related: Oil Tankers Jam Seas as Global Glut Builds

This year, Japan plans to take its first steps to achieving space solar power by launching a 180 kg satellite into low Earth orbit to send a meagre 1 KW of power to a ground antenna. While the energy output is expected to be very low, if achieved it could encourage other governments to run pilot projects to eventually achieve commercial solar space power production. The project is called OHISAMA, the Japanese for sun.

For future commercial operations, receiving antennas on Earth will need to be big enough to receive the power, spanning several kilometres, as the solar satellites will be travelling at an immense 28,000 kilometres an hour. However, Japan plans to use thirteen receivers spread over a 600-square-metre area in the city of Suwa to capture the microwaves sent from the solar panels, to provide proof on concept. If successful, Japan plans to launch bigger solar satellites to transmit more clean power to Earth.

Meanwhile, in 2023, in the United States, Caltech successfully demonstrated its Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD-1), the first space-borne prototype from the university’s Space Solar Power Project (SSPP). MAPLE, short for Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment, has an array of flexible lightweight microwave power transmitters driven by custom electronic chips that were built using low-cost silicon technologies, which researchers aim to use to deliver space solar power to Earth.

To achieve space solar power, governments and scientists worldwide must work together to understand the potential risks of the technology rollout as well as establish international regulations on the use of space solar power satellites. This will lay the groundwork for the testing of innovative space solar technologies over the coming decades, which could be used to significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels in support of a global green transition.

[TITLE]U.S. Sanctions Hit Serbian Oil Industry Hard:
[TEXT]
The sanctions, aimed at preventing the financing of Russia's war in Ukraine, have prompted Croatia to offer to buy NIS if Serbia considers it a solution, while Serbia, heavily dependent on Russian gas, continues to navigate its complex relationship with both Russia and the West.

NIS, which was placed on the US sanctions list in January due to its "secondary risk" and Russian ownership, announced that its special license from the US Treasury was not extended, leading to operational challenges despite having secured sufficient oil stocks.

The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said sanctions against the Russian-owned Oil Industry of Serbia (NIS), Serbia's sole crude oil refiner, have taken force after several delays, a move that could hit the Balkan nation hard.

NIS said on October 9 that a special license from the US Treasury that allows the company to operate was not extended after being delayed eight times since the company was first put on the US sanctions list in January for its "secondary risk," its Russian ownership.

The sanctions are aimed, among other things, at preventing the financing of the Kremlin's war in Ukraine by Russian energy companies.

"The company has not been extended a special license by the United States Department of Finance, which enables smooth operational business," NIS said in a statement.

"Since the listing of the company on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list in January, NIS has been carefully monitoring the situation and trying to adapt its operations to the new circumstances...NIS has secured sufficient stocks of oil for processing at this time, while gas stations are properly supplied with all types of oil derivatives."

Kremlin-controlled Gazprom Neft, directly or through its subsidiaries, is the main owner of substantial energy assets in Serbia. Since 2008, Gazprom has owned a large stake in NIS, Serbia's national oil and gas company.

Although Serbia has repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion at the United Nations and other international forums, it has so far refused to join Western sanctions against Moscow.

Serbia is heavily dependent on Russian gas and is currently in talks for a new supply deal.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on October 7 that Belgrade will discuss ways to resolve problems created by the sanctions with Russia.

"We no longer have anything to discuss with the Americans. The United States has imposed its will on others and Europe will support American sanctions," said Vucic.

The ownership structure of NIS has been changed several times as the company looked to avoid the sanctions, but it is still mostly in the hands of Russian companies.

Gazprom in September transferred its shares to one of its subsidiaries based in St. Petersburg, which now holds 11.3 percent of the company's shares, according to data published on the website of the Belgrade Stock Exchange on September 21.

Gazprom Neft, a subsidiary of Gazprom, still holds the largest share in NIS at 44.9 percent, while Serbia owns 29.9 percent. The remainder is held by small shareholders.

In January, Vucic rejected the possibility of nationalizing NIS, adding that Serbia "will not participate in the seizure of Russian property."

"The financial sector will have to stop working with NIS - halt all transactions and cooperation immediately - to avoid being considered a bank dealing with a sanctioned entity," he added.

Industry experts said crude oil deliveries to Serbia, as well as exports of fuel, and higher gasoline prices are likely to be among the negative consequences of the US sanctions against NIS, which supplies over 80 percent of Serbia's diesel and petrol fuels.

The consequences of the US sanctions against NIS are likely also to ripple across neighboring countries, with the Serbian oil firm having operations in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Romania, and Bulgaria.

Croatian President Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said on October 9 that his country is ready to buy the NIS if Serbia sees the sale as a potential solution, noting Croatia's oil firm Jadranski Naftovod has been closely linked to NIS for 40 years "without any pretensions to dominate the retail market in Serbia."

"That would make it easier for both us and Serbia," he said.

Serbia, which applied to join the European Union in 2009 and started negotiations in 2014, has not responded to the comments.

[TITLE]‘No trade-off’ between sustainability and growth, India can grow by 7.5-8%: Nicholas Stern:
[TEXT]
There is no trade-off between economic growth and moving to renewable sources of energy and India can even increase its GDP growth rate to 7.5-8 per cent from 6.5 per cent currently by aggressively investing in its green transition, according to NICHOLAS STERN, the IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government at the London School of Economics.

“…you still get that residual argument that somehow a developing nation will have to choose between sustainability and climate on the one hand and growth in incomes on the other. That’s absolutely wrong…and it’s very important we are very clear that there is no trade-off,” he said in an interview with The Indian Express. Stern also said the path India takes to becoming a developed economy by 2047 will be crucial for the world and that it needs to increase its investment-to-GDP ratio by 5 percentage points, remove impediments to investment, get the incentives right to invest in modern technologies – particularly green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Edited excerpts:

US President Donald Trump’s focus has been on tariff policies. But he is also undoing years of progress made in the renewables sector. Is that more dangerous than the chaos the trade disruptions are causing?

Trump has been disruptive in a number of directions. One, of course, is the tariffs and the structure of world trade. Another is health, where he’s taking the US away from the World Health Organization (WHO) and attacking vaccinations. On security, he is backing off from the defence of Europe. Aid has been dismantled.

Story continues below this ad

One important way forward for the rest of the world is to stay united on these issues. If the US is undermining WTO, which it is, then try to find trade agreements between nations which look quite similar. I think it would be very good if the EU trade agreement (with India) – which I think is coming – looks like the one with the UK. I hope there’ll be more trade agreements with Asia. The more they look similar, the more we’re sustaining the idea that trade should be symmetric and with minimal barriers because we all benefit from that.

In many ways, climate is similar (to health and trade) – we have the international fora where we can find agreements and carry on. At the same time, the cost of solar and batteries has fallen dramatically. If we compare with 1975, it’s not that it has fallen by a factor of 100 – it’s fallen by a factor close to 1,000, which is extraordinary. It is unambiguously the cheapest form of electricity generation.

On the climate side, the forces of change are strong. But we are going nowhere near fast enough. We are probably heading, given current policies, to something like 2.5-3°C (rise in temperatures); we’re already at

[TITLE]Kyiv calls for more support from allies as Russian drones and missiles strike energy facilities in Ukraine:
[TEXT]
One child killed and 20 people injured, as Vladimir Putin intensifies attacks on specific targets

Large parts of Kyiv were plunged into darkness in the early hours of yesterday after Russian drones and missiles struck Ukrainian energy facilities, cutting power and water to homes and halting a key metro link across the Dnipro river.

In the latest mass attack targeting the energy system as winter approaches, electricity was interrupted in nine regions and around 854,000 consumers were temporarily without power across the country. Ukraine’s prime minister called it one of the heaviest such strikes to date.

In south-eastern Ukraine, a seven-year-old was killed when his home was hit and at least 20 people were injured.

In Kyiv, an apartment block in the city centre was damaged by a projectile, while on the left bank of the Dnipro that divides the capital, crowds waited at bus stops with the metro out of action and people filled water bottles at distribution points.

“We didn’t sleep at all,” said Liuba, a pensioner, as she collected water. “From 2.30am there was so much noise. By 3.30am we had no electricity, no gas, no water. Nothing.”

Ukrainians are bracing for a tough winter, as the full-scale war nears its fourth anniversary. Russia has intensified attacks on the energy system in recent weeks, striking power plants and gas production facilities, and local authorities are struggling with the scale of repairs required. “It is precisely the civilian and energy infrastructure that is the main target of Russia’s strikes ahead of the heating season,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

Calling for more support from Kyiv’s allies, he said: “What’s needed is not window dressing but decisive action – from the United States, Europe, and the G7 – in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions.”

In Kyiv, energy minister Svitlana Hrynchuk met G7 ambassadors and representatives from some of Ukraine’s biggest energy companies to discuss how allies could help protect the country against further attacks and repair the damage.

Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who was visiting Ukraine yeserday, said his country was looking at ways to support its neighbour.

Ukraine’s air force said it had downed 405 of 465 drones and 15 of 32 missiles in this attack. Ukraine’s stretched air defences are no match for regular barrages on such a scale.

Russia said its overnight strikes were in response to Ukraine’s attacks on Russian civilian facilities. Ukraine regularly launches drone strikes against Russia, focusing on oil installations, although they are generally on a far smaller scale. Kyiv says it wants to force Moscow, which started the war, to negotiate a peace deal in good faith.

For many Kyiv residents, the day started with power cuts, disruptions in the water supply and transport delays.

“We had no power or water when I left my house. I can’t get to work because the subway is not operating and buses are overflowing,” Anatoliy, a 23-year-old student, said.

“I’m hoping for the best, but I don’t even know how to reach the other bank (of the Dnipro),” he said, after spending the night in his hallway because of loud explosions.

Prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko said the assault was among the heaviest concentrated strikes on energy infrastructure and reported significant damage.

Her deputy, Oleksiy Kuleba, said two million customers in Kyiv temporarily faced problems with water supplies.

Ukrainian private energy firm DTEK said its thermal power plants had suffered significant damage in the attack.

The government said it expected the water supply to the capital to be restored by last night.

[TITLE]Regulated monopolies: Capital markets can solve surging power prices * WorldNetDaily * by Jordan McGillis, Real Clear Wire:

Ratepayers across the U.S. have been shocked this year by record electricity prices. In July, according to the latest numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average residential rate in the state of New York was 26.18 cents per kilowatt hour and in California it was a whopping 32.58. Those rates are up 40% and 62% respectively over the same month five years ago, while the national average has risen 32% in that period. What is causing these runaway rates?

[TITLE]What Israel’s war in Gaza reveals about the nature of cruelty and the myths around it:
[TEXT]
Once again, the Levant is on the verge of peace. I know what to say about how long this peace would last, but I wish to be more hopeful than prescient, even though I am a columnist. By many measures, Israel won this war. The peace is a consequence of the decimation of Hamas and the end of a famous myth that Iran is a military equal of Israel.

The victor achieved this by being brutal. It appeared to consider Palestinian and even Iranian civilian casualties collateral damage. This removed Hamas’s most effective shield, Palestinian civilians. Israel also rendered ineffective another Hamas shield—international opinion.

The country went ahead with its objective of finishing off Hamas with no regard for what the world had to say, and most of the world had only one thing to say—that it had to stop. With only the US on its side, Israel was responsible, by its own admission, for the death of at least hundreds of Palestinians who were not armed threats.

Also Read | Manu Joseph: What being in awe of Israel actually says about people

Where did Israel find the moral courage to do this? There is a popular view that Israel, as a Jewish state, is so aggressive because Jews have been historically persecuted in Europe, and that gives it the privilege to consider itself specially placed to defend itself by any means at its disposal.

I don’t think that is what is going on. There may be a more interesting aspect of human nature at work.

There is this implication about people who have gone through suffering, oppression or bias that they are bitter and deal with the world with bitterness or meanness or cruelty. Some groups of people have a reputation for being relatively nasty, and they are sometimes presumed to be so because they were or are persecuted.

What may appear to be, at first glance, a sympathetic understanding is in reality a stereotype. I have no problems with stereotypes. Usually, they are approximations of complex truths that help us grasp complex things about society. But often the stereotype is plain wrong.

All groups have people who may be kind or mean or cruel, and in any given group of people, there would be some proportion who are capable of cruelty. What may differ is how empowered they feel to express themselves. People in the social mainstream cannot express their meanness, but persecuted groups can. This, I believe, is true of all persecuted groups that have a reputation for being mean.

There is a minority within them who feel so morally empowered to be cruel that their actions become facile representations of their whole community. A handful of aggressive alpha males can create an impression that a more peaceful majority cannot.

A factor that makes this stereotype stronger is empathy, when a public figure, for instance, ‘forgives’ the behaviour of members of such a community because “they have been through much."

Guess which group almost never seems to have a specific reputation for being publicly mean, bitter or cruel—straight mainstream men. This may not only be because they are too broad a group to have specific attributes. To my mind, this is chiefly because they have no easy moral basis to be cruel. As a result, the cruel among them can only be so in their private lives.

Some of them seem to go the woke way to expend that capacity because that offers them a moral way to defame and belittle other people.

Israelis who had the natural capacity for cruelty, aggression or violence could channel their temperament for what they saw as an exquisite moral cause. As a result, they could rise swiftly in their nation as exceptional individuals who could influence the political and military strategies of Israel. A hawk in a nation that has a moral market for hawks has a very different level of prestige than a hawk in a more placid place like India or America.

While Israel has had anti-war protests too and its leadership is yet to face its electorate, with elections overdue, I believe this is one of the important reasons why the country could deploy armed forces to blast children and other innocent people in Gaza with such ferocity that it came close to committing a particular kind of atrocity that is rarer than the word’s fame suggests— ‘genocide’.

Genocide is a word that the global left uses carelessly. Riots in India have falsely been described as such. If you object to it, lovers of the word will make you feel you are a murderer yourself. Maybe these people have seen so little of real life that they need to react in this manner to project gravitas. But in the case of what Israel was doing in Gaza, especially over the last year, it was becoming hard to deny the accuracy of the word. It was becoming hard to deny that we were watching the annihilation of a people because of who they are.

This level of organized aggression might appear to spring from within Israeli society, which may have seen a moral justification for it. But I would argue that the war’s ravages are explained by the actions of only a few individuals with a disposition to cruelty.

The rise of Hamas in Gaza itself could be explained by the same phenomenon among Palestinians. The long oppression of Palestinians gave a moral halo to those among them who were disposed to violence and they gravitated towards a violent moral cause. That made them folk heroes and materially wealthy.

Injustice does not make its victims any more cruel than people who do not face the same misery. It just gives a free pass to a small fraction of any such population to be themselves.

[TITLE]Prince George, B.C., business owners want state of emergency declared due to downtown arsons:
[TEXT]
Business owners in downtown Prince George are calling for a local state of emergency to be declared after a recent series of fires have threatened their businesses.

In the past week alone, fires were set outside the Nancy O's and Betulla Burning restaurants, which led owner Eoin Foley to send an email on Friday to Mayor Simon Yu, council, MPs, MLAs, RCMP and local media to draw attention to the matter.

"Business owners are in a desperate crisis," said Foley, who is also president of the downtown business association. "This is a constant, daily threat. If this does not constitute [the need for] emergency action, what possibly does?

"I am very grateful that Nancy O's did not burn to the ground," he said, noting the scorch marks on the building.

The fire issue has become a flashpoint since Sept. 5 when CrossRoads Brewing, a cornerstone downtown business, was destroyed in an apparent arson just steps away from city hall. It's estimated that the fire caused $1.8 million in damage and the owners have said they will not reopen in the location without safety improvements to the area.

"We are under siege," CrossRoads co-owners Daryl Leiski and Cindy Zurowski wrote to council in a letter dated Sept. 16, in which they asked the city to take action.

WATCH | Downtown businesses say they can no longer operate without improved security: Prince George brewery destroyed by alleged arson says it won't rebuild unless 'security improves' Duration 2:27 A popular Prince George, B.C., brewery destroyed by alleged arson says it won't be rebuilding unless the safety situation in the city's downtown improves. As the CBC's Andrew Kurjata reports, that's expected to be one of the top issues, as municipal leaders from around B.C. meet in Victoria later this month.

Since then, other businesses have been sharing their experience of finding scorch marks and burning materials outside their buildings on a regular basis. Just days after the CrossRoads fire, nightclub owner Michelle Sakamoto found smoldering cardboard jammed into the doorway of her business.

"It's like a kick in the teeth," she said. "We just can't seem to keep up with it."

Other business owners and managers have chimed in, sharing fear that another business will soon be lost to an unattended or intentional fire.

"This problem continues to grow and we need to use every tool available to our downtown," said Darren Low, the owner of City Furniture. He was one of a number of business representatives that responded to Foley's email and agreed to be quoted by CBC.

Warren Sunstrum, a chef at Betulla Burning, shared his own pictures of a burned tree, which he said he took after witnessing a man dousing a hoodie in gasoline then setting it on fire. It was "a blatant act of vandalism and arson."

"The police never showed up, there was no investigation, nor was there any footage collected to try and find this criminal. And this was just days after CrossRoad burned down," he wrote.

Chef Warren Sunstrum says he has witnessed people use gasoline to start fires in downtown Prince George, and has had difficulty getting rapid police response. (Warren Sunstrum)

Nancy O's and Betualla co-owner Garrett Fedorkiw said declaring a local state of emergency would send "a strong signal" that elected leaders "mean business and are ready to defend our community."

"Confidence is at an all-time low," he wrote. "People are scared."

Mayor Yu and the council did not respond to the emails publicly. And the city was not immediately available to comment when CBC News reached out to them.

[TITLE]EQT scraps Zelestra India sale, brings in O2's Parag Sharma to lead $600 mn push:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: European alternative asset manager EQT has dropped the plan to sell renewable developer Zelestra’s India operations and instead transferred it to its Asia Pacific infrastructure team headed by Hong Kong-based partner Ken Wong.

EQT will also invest around $600 million to develop the portfolio and has brought in Parag Sharma, former chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of EQT—and Temasek-backed O2 Power, to head the company, replacing incumbent CEO Sajay K.V., said four people aware of the development.

Zelestra had hired JP Morgan to run the sale process for its India operations, eyeing a deal with an equity and enterprise value of $184 million and $421 million, respectively. Mint earlier reported that the world’s largest alternative asset manager Blackstone was looking to acquire Zelestra’s Indian operations.

The new plan is to carve out Zelestra India as a separate company and build it on similar lines as O2 Power, which was sold to JSW Neo Energy in December last year for an enterprise value of $1.47 billion.

“EQT is not selling Zelestra India now. The plan is to build another O2 Power. While the sale process run by JP Morgan was on, it was decided that EQT’s Asia Pacific team would take Zelestra India forward on similar lines as was done for O2 Power," said one of the four people cited above, requesting anonymity. “It will still be housed under the EQT Infrastructure V fund, but placed under a different partner. The plan is to infuse another $600 million in expanding Zelestra India portfolio."

The second person cited above, who also did not want to be named, said, “EQT Asia infrastructure team is carving out Zelestra India operations out of Zelestra and will run it as a portfolio company."

Sharma, who has already joined Zelestra India as its new CEO, declined to comment. Sajay K.V. did not respond to phone calls or a message left on his cellphone.

Spokespersons for EQT, Zelestra, JP Morgan and Blackstone declined to comment.

Zelestra India has an operational capacity of 600 megawatt (MW), with an additional 2 gigawatt (GW) contracted portfolio, of which 1.5GW is under construction. The green energy platform is targeting 8.6GW capacity by 2031.

Sajay K.V. had taken over as the CEO of Zelestra’s Indian business unit in December 2023, after stints with BrightNight Power, Hero Future Energies, Siemens Gamesa and Vestas.

EQT has €273 billion in assets under management. Zelestra has a 29GW of global portfolio in 13 countries and has been present in India since 2015.

India’s green energy capacity addition has been on an upward trajectory. With a solar power sector potential of 748GW, India has an installed renewable energy capacity of 245GW, of which solar and wind power account for 116GW and 52GW, respectively. The country plans to add 50GW of green energy capacity annually to reach 500GW by 2030. Given the nation’s green energy transition trajectory and the net-zero target by 2070, the plan is to add 1,800GW of renewable energy capacity by 2047 and 5,000GW by 2070.

This large scale of India’s green energy space has opened up mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities and attracted global and domestic investor interest.

“The power sector led M&A activity worth US$8.5 billion, driven largely by the renewable energy sector's growth," wrote EY in a 13 August report.

“The renewable energy sector in India alone contributed around 80% of the power sector’s total, marking a significant increase from US$3.2 billion in H1 2024 and US$2.8 billion in H2 2024, indicating a strong interest in sustainable investments," the EY report said.

“India is now recognized as the world’s fourth-largest renewable energy market, having attracted over US$4 billion in FDI in the past year alone… The presence of over 60 marquee global investors, a strong track record of profitable exits and a progressive policy framework are accelerating the shift towards the next level of growth in renewable energy," the report said.

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]
Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defence, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world’s lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60-70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union — long-term trading partners with African nations — have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa’s resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa’s position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasise local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa’s critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another “resource curse.”

The emerging ‘New World Order’

A Chinese-led ‘New World Order’ is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organisations. The initiative has expanded China’s access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent

[TITLE]‘No trade-off’ between sustainability and growth, India can grow by 7.5-8%: Nicholas Stern:
[TEXT]
There is no trade-off between economic growth and moving to renewable sources of energy and India can even increase its GDP growth rate to 7.5-8 per cent from 6.5 per cent currently by aggressively investing in its green transition, according to NICHOLAS STERN, the IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government at the London School of Economics.

“…you still get that residual argument that somehow a developing nation will have to choose between sustainability and climate on the one hand and growth in incomes on the other. That’s absolutely wrong…and it’s very important we are very clear that there is no trade-off,” he said in an interview with The Indian Express. Stern also said the path India takes to becoming a developed economy by 2047 will be crucial for the world and that it needs to increase its investment-to-GDP ratio by 5 percentage points, remove impediments to investment, get the incentives right to invest in modern technologies – particularly green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Edited excerpts:

US President Donald Trump’s focus has been on tariff policies. But he is also undoing years of progress made in the renewables sector. Is that more dangerous than the chaos the trade disruptions are causing?

Trump has been disruptive in a number of directions. One, of course, is the tariffs and the structure of world trade. Another is health, where he’s taking the US away from the World Health Organization (WHO) and attacking vaccinations. On security, he is backing off from the defence of Europe. Aid has been dismantled.

Story continues below this ad

One important way forward for the rest of the world is to stay united on these issues. If the US is undermining WTO, which it is, then try to find trade agreements between nations which look quite similar. I think it would be very good if the EU trade agreement (with India) – which I think is coming – looks like the one with the UK. I hope there’ll be more trade agreements with Asia. The more they look similar, the more we’re sustaining the idea that trade should be symmetric and with minimal barriers because we all benefit from that.

In many ways, climate is similar (to health and trade) – we have the international fora where we can find agreements and carry on. At the same time, the cost of solar and batteries has fallen dramatically. If we compare with 1975, it’s not that it has fallen by a factor of 100 – it’s fallen by a factor close to 1,000, which is extraordinary. It is unambiguously the cheapest form of electricity generation.

On the climate side, the forces of change are strong. But we are going nowhere near fast enough. We are probably heading, given current policies, to something like 2.5-3°C (rise in temperatures); we’re already at

[TITLE]Regulated monopolies: Capital markets can solve surging power prices * WorldNetDaily * by Jordan McGillis, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
Ratepayers across the U.S. have been shocked this year by record electricity prices. In July, according to the latest numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average residential rate in the state of New York was 26.18 cents per kilowatt hour and in California it was a whopping 32.58. Those rates are up 40% and 62% respectively over the same month five years ago, while the national average has risen 32% in that period. What is causing these runaway rates?

One factor is inflation economy-wide. Cumulatively, prices have risen for all goods and services by

[TITLE]Renewable surge stalled: India adds 26.8 GW power but grid expansion lags:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India’s race to expand clean energy is running into a transmission bottleneck. Even as new power generation capacity has nearly tripled to 26.8 GW so far this fiscal year, expansion of the transmission backbone is faltering. Just 1,998 circuit kilometers (ckm) of new lines were added till August, 30% less than a year ago, against a full-year target of 15,382 ckm, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).

The gap between generation and transmission is already stranding projects. A JMK Research study estimates that nearly 50 GW of renewable capacity nationwide cannot be evacuated because of inadequate infrastructure, inflating per-unit transmission costs, weakening project viability and deterring private investment.

Developers such as ACME Solar and AMPIN Energy have petitioned the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) seeking compensation for financial losses from delayed transmission connections.

Of the 26.8 GW installed this year, renewable energy accounts for 20.1 GW, followed by coal or other thermal projects of 3.6 GW, hydro capacity of 2.4 GW and nuclear power of 700 MW. While the ramp-up in clean power is critical for India’s target of 500 GW non-fossil capacity by 2030, the absence of robust evacuation infrastructure risks slowing its impact.

Unlike coal, solar and wind are intermittent and require stronger networks to assure stability of the grid and the power system.

Ironically, parts of the existing transmission system remain underused even as new projects wait for grid access. Analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicates that up to 71% of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) corridors operate below 30% utilisation, underscoring a mismatch between where lines exist and where power flows are required.

Last year, only 8,830 ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253 ckm, a 42% shortfall, with ISTS additions at their lowest in a decade.

From April to August this year, state utilities built 1,263 ckm of lines and central government-backed companies added 708 ckm, both falling short of their targets of 1,444 ckm and 717 ckm, respectively. The private sector, with a smaller share, met its target of 27 ckm during the period.

Private sector interest rises amid delays Despite the shortfall, private interest is rising: in the first half of 2025, more than 30 power sector firms, mostly transmission companies and infrastructure investment trusts, were incorporated amid slackening growth in capacity addition.

The Centre has been making efforts to accelerate transmission line expansion in the country as the deadline of 500 GW non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030 draws closer. According to the CEA’s National Electricity Plan, India will need an additional 191,000 ckm of transmission lines by FY32, requiring a cumulative investment of

[TITLE]Experts outline 10-year blueprint for energy sector reform:
[TEXT]
Business News of Thursday, 9 October 2025

Source: thebftonline.com

Energy policy experts, regulators and financiers meeting at the 2025 Ghana Economic Forum’s (GEF) Energy Sector Roundtable have proposed a series of structural reforms aimed at transforming the power sector into a self-sustaining and resilient system over the next decade.

Divided into five working groups, participants addressed the sector’s most persistent challenges – including debt accumulation, inefficiency, unreliable generation and limited investment – and outlined a roadmap focused on governance reform, local financing, diversified energy sources and regulatory transparency.

The roundtable, convened by B&FT ahead of the 14th GEF, brought together representatives from the Ministry of Energy, Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC), financial institutions, private investors and civil society to identify actionable steps that will strengthen the power value chain.

In opening the session, Board Chair at B&FT, Dr Edith Dankwa underscored the urgency of finding durable solutions to energy challenges, describing reliable power as “the backbone of national growth and competitiveness”.

She explained that the roundtable’s purpose was to move beyond diagnosis to measurable reform.

“We cannot keep diagnosing the same problems every year. This platform is
