[TITLE]Five important financial moves for PhD students:
[TEXT]
PhD students can live on a modest stipend and still save for the future, financial planners say.Credit: Images By Tang Ming Tung/Getty

At a mellow surf spot near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Paige Hoel smiled to herself; as an oceanographer, she understood why the waves were breaking just so. Between 2014 and 2024, she had earned her undergraduate degree, a master’s and a doctorate. But her passion for the field did not come without financial strain.

“I spent my 20s pursuing this,” says Hoel, who adds that her father lived on a “shoestring budget” during his own time as a PhD student. “I knew I had to hustle to support myself.”

PhD parents: the pros and cons of having a child during your doctorate

PhD candidates do not just commit to long hours and intense research, but also to the financial uncertainty that comes with low stipends relative to high costs of living, especially in urban locations. As a PhD student at the University of California, Hoel earned US$30,000–36,000 per year, along with the benefits of waived tuition, health care and a gym membership. The financial strain can persist into early-career training and result in a limited capacity to save and invest in the future.

“This is the time to plan and build a foundation for yourself, one that sticks,” says Brian Skinner, a financial planner at Skinner Wealth Strategies in Milford, Connecticut. Specialists such as Skinner say that completing a PhD and feeling financially stable are not mutually exclusive. Here are five personal financial strategies for before, during and after a PhD programme that students and financial advisers say could help individuals to feel more secure.

Create and stick to a budget

Financial management begins with identifying your goals, then creating a budget that reflects them. Generally, a well-planned budget is a blueprint for how to control costs and make informed decisions each month as income arrives and expenses flow out.

First, identify all regular costs, such as rent, food, debt and savings. The rule of thumb, according to financial advisers, is to allocate up to 50% of your take-home pay to essential expenses, 15–20% to retirement funds and savings accounts, and 5% to an emergency fund. PhD students should focus on covering fixed expenses and building accessible savings, financial planners say.

“You need to break down what your priorities are and then budget to live within your means,” Skinner says.

When Rodrigo Dios completed his PhD in zoology in 2020 at the University of São Paulo, he was living in one of the most expensive cities in Brazil. (During his master’s studies, he lived in his family home to save money.) “I received one of the biggest grants in Brazil and things were really tight,” he says.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.

And this week on Face the Nation: In this holiday season, with more Americans saying they're feeling the pain of higher prices, we will talk exclusively with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

As Washington winds down 2025, there's still a lot of unfinished business for Congress and President Trump. And, as Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, doubles down on those boat strikes in the Caribbean…

(Begin VT)

PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): We are tracking them, we are killing them, and we will keep killing them so long as they are poisoning our people with narcotics so lethal that they're tantamount to chemical weapons.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: … the debate over whether they were lawful ramps up on Capitol Hill.

We will talk with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut's Jim Himes.

Plus, the deportation roundups continue in the nation's cities, this time targeting communities in Minneapolis, including the congresswoman who represents most of the city.

(Begin VT)

DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren't people that work.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Representative Ilhan Omar.

And, finally, a major change to vaccine guidance for newborns recommended by a panel of advisers chosen by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

DR. CODY MEISSNER (Advisory Committee On Immunization Practices): We have heard do no harm is a moral imperative. We are doing harm.

And we begin with the secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent.

Good to have you here.

SCOTT BESSENT (U.S. Treasury Secretary): Good morning, Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are out there holiday shopping. Here is how the president described back in April what to expect from this season.

(Begin VT)

DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Maybe the children will have two dolls, instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the president's prediction then correct?

SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it's actually been a very strong holiday season, and the – you know, we've seen across the – all the income cohorts thus far. And so there's nothing to say that there are two dolls, instead of 30 dolls.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The president was wrong to predict lower numbers of purchases and higher prices?

SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The economy has been better than we thought. We've had the 4 – 4 percent GDP growth in a couple of quarters. We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3 percent real GDP growth.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the maker of Tonka trucks, their CEO said it's going to cost 40 bucks for their toys right now because of tariffs and inflation. It was 30 bucks the year before that, 25.

Prices in the toy space are accelerating, and people are feeling that.

SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, inflation is a composite number, and it's roughly the same year over year. And if we were to look at all imported goods, imported goods inflation is below the inflation number.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The inflation number, you mean the…

SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The PC – the PCE number, which is

[TITLE]BasicNet Plans to Relocate Woolrich Corporate Employees to Turin, Trade Unions Push Back:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Less than a month after BasicNet acquired Woolrich from Luxembourg-based fund L-Gam in a deal that valued the storied outerwear player at 90 million euros, the new owner is facing a dispute with trade unions.

The latter are claiming that the company has decided to shut corporate operations in Bologna and Milan, where Woolrich employs 109 and 30 workers, respectively, leaving them with no other option than accept a relocation to the BasicNet headquarters in Turin to avoid being laid off.

The move would not affect retail employees in those cities, where Woolrich operates two of its 25 flagships in Europe.

BasicNet’s portfolio of brands also comprises Kappa, Robe di Kappa, K-Way, Superga, Sebago and Briko, in addition to Woolrich and beachwear specialist Sundek. The latter’s acquisition was revealed Thursday.

On Friday, BasicNet issued a statement clarifying its position, saying that “this is not a closure, but rather a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring job continuity. The decision to move the headquarters and its employees to Turin is designed to strengthen Woolrich’s brand value by investing in a central hub that can support future growth and create beneficial synergies.”

The company said it is committed to safeguarding jobs and will resort to any available welfare measure to ensure a smooth transition for employees unable to relocate to Turin.

“People are the heart of the company, and we are excited to welcome all employees into the big BasicNet family,” said Alessandro Boglione, co-chief executive officer of BasicNet, in the statement. “We are committed to following all the right procedures, which is why we are working closely with trade unions to provide clear and timely answers to employees who have sought clarity.”

“We hope to find shared solutions quickly so we can provide certainty and ensure the transition respects everyone involved,” added Lorenzo Boglione, co-CEO of the company.

The BasicNet transaction, revealed in November, involved the acquisition through a wholly owned subsidiary of the rights to the Woolrich brand for Europe and 100 percent of Woolrich Europe SpA, the company managing its distribution and retail activities. Its revenues for fiscal year 2025 are expected to be around 90 million euros.

Through the deal L-Gam exited Woolrich seven years after acquiring the brand in 2018 from its former owner, WP Lavori in Corso. Last December L-Gam forged a deal with Chinese apparel group Baoxiniao Holding Co. Ltd., which acquired Woolrich’s intellectual property rights for all territories outside Europe.

Woolrich was founded in 1830 by John Rich in Pennsylvania, and is one of the oldest American producers of wool fabrics and outdoor clothing. The company was created to provide durable and functional garments for hunters, lumberjacks and railway workers.

In 1850, Woolrich introduced its signature Buffalo red and black check pattern. In 1940, responding to the needs of workers building oil pipelines in Alaska, the Arctic Parka was born — designed to withstand extreme temperatures and another signature garment for the brand.

BasicNet was founded by Lorenzo and Alessandro Boglione’s father, Marco Boglione, who created the group in 1994 as a marketplace and publicly listed it on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1999.

Stemming from the storied traditional clothing company Maglificio Calzificio Torinese, which was founded in 1916, BasicNet doesn’t produce or distribute the collections of its brands. Billing itself as a “fully web-integrated company” through a digitally advanced platform, it acts as a marketplace where manufacturers and distributors meet to do business.

In particular, BasicNet designs and develops its labels’ collections, signs licensing agreements with international producers and distributors, which receive from BasicNet all they need to manufacture and sell the products, from research and development to global marketing.

[TEXT]
Delivered Net Sales of $1.472 Billion, a 9% Increase Versus Prior Year, Exceeding Expectations

Operating Results and Earnings Exceed Expectations

Raises Fiscal Year 2025 Net Sales, Operating Income and Earnings Guidance

REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Victoria’s Secret & Co. (“VS&Co” or the “Company”) (NYSE: VSCO) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Hillary Super, VS&Co Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a standout third quarter, with outperformance on net sales and earnings per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Net sales increased 9% over last year, driven by strength across Victoria’s Secret, PINK and Beauty, and supported by momentum across channels and geographies. These outstanding results reflect disciplined execution of our Path to Potential strategy. Building on the third quarter’s outperformance as well as the solid start to our fourth quarter, we are raising our full year outlook and are well positioned for a successful holiday season and finish to our fiscal 2025.”

Ms. Super concluded, “With two iconic brands, Victoria’s Secret and PINK, a curated product assortment, high-emotion marketing and a relentless customer focus, we are reinforcing our leadership in global intimates and beauty. As we continue to advance our Path to Potential strategy, we are accelerating global growth, elevating brand distinctiveness, and unlocking greater value across our ecosystem to drive long-term profitable growth.”

Scott Sekella, VS&Co Chief Financial and Operating Officer, said, “Building on strong first-half results, our third quarter exceeded expectations. We delivered robust adjusted gross margin expansion of 170 basis points, driven by a reduced promotional approach and higher regular-priced selling, while leveraging the strength of our business model. We remain focused on managing costs while prioritizing investments in product innovation, brand strength, and customer experience. These efforts, along with the solid operational foundation we have built enables us to scale effectively and support the Company’s growth, giving us confidence in delivering a strong finish to the year and positioning VS&Co for long-term success.”

Third Quarter 2025 Results

The Company reported net sales of $1.472 billion for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 9% compared to net sales of $1.347 billion for the third quarter of 2024 and above our previously communicated guidance range of $1.390 billion to $1.420 billion. Total comparable sales for the third quarter of 2025 increased 8%.

[TITLE]PVH Stock Drops 11.8% as Wall Street Waits for Fundamentals to Improve:
[TEXT]
Updated 4:13 p.m. ET Dec. 4

Wall Street is still waiting for PVH Corp. to take off.

Shares of the company fell 11.8 percent to $77.21 on Thursday, after the company beat its third-quarter earnings estimates, but didn’t raise its outlook for the year, signaling that business will be spread out between the two quarters.

“PVH shares look cheap, but they sure aren’t making it easy for value investors to step in,” said Tom Nikic, an analyst at Needham. “Trends continue to be very volatile.”

The Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company saw third-quarter revenues increase 2 percent to $2.3 billion, making for a drop of less than 1 percent in constant currencies. PVH expects revenues to be flat to slightly positive for the year, in constant currencies.

Nikic zeroed in on the company’s “negative inflection” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa division, which trended down 2 percent in constant currencies.

“This was expected to be one of the growth drivers of the business following last year’s reset of the market — a gross margin miss didn’t help either,” the analyst said. “We continue to believe that shares are too cheap, particularly since they can probably buy back a high-single-digit percent of the float annually at these levels, if not more.

“Third-quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points, missing guidance by 25 basis points, driven by tariffs (110 basis point negative impact), the impact of bringing licenses in-house (50 basis points) and higher promotional mix, partially due to the … Calvin Klein product shipment delays,” he said.

PVH has been busy taking back licenses for its North American wholesale business from G-III Apparel Group, absorbing some of the businesses and finding other licensees for some categories, including dresses.

In conjunction with that take-back, the company set up a “global product kitchen” for Calvin Klein in New York, a complicated switch that had an uneven start.

Stefan Larsson, chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call Thursday that the “delays from the transitory Calvin global product challenges put extra strain on our European distribution center, impacting shipments for both Calvin and Tommy, which made us lose a few critical weeks of full-price selling.”

But Larsson, who’s been busy remaking the company since stepping into the corner office in 2021, suggested it was growing pains the company was feeling.

“We are on track both from on-time delivery coming into spring ’26 and the margin recapture that we set out to take back. On both fronts, we are on track, which is really good,” he said. “It’s painful now, but we had to do it because in order to build premium products, differentiated product franchises with innovation, we need the global capability to do that. And now we have it for both Calvin and Tommy. And so do all of our best competitors in the premium space also have it. But we had to build that. And now you start to see it.”

But Wall Street is still waiting.

Matthew Boss, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said: “While we see multiyear brand ‘unlock’ underway with the new leadership team focused on driving increased desirability of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands through improved product design and marketing, we see an elongated path to reaching management’s mid-teens operating margin target given a slower top-line recovery with continued macroeconomic challenges globally, in addition to a competitive external promotional backdrop, and foreign exchange pressures.”

This year, PVH expects its adjusted operating margin to come in at about 8.5 percent.

[TITLE]Global luxury apparel market to rebound slowly after 2024 setback – analysis:
[TEXT]
Louis Vuitton remained the largest luxury apparel brand in 2024, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Credit: Peter_Fleming/Shutterstock.

The global luxury apparel market will undergo a gradual recovery after a 2.4% contraction in 2024, analysis indicates.

According to GlobalData Global Luxury Apparel Market to 2029 report, growth will return in 2025, but it is expected to be largely fuelled by price increases rather than higher sales volumes.

Macro pressures including inflation across Europe and the US and a sharp slowdown in China dented consumer spending last year, producing the market’s first material setback in several years. GlobalData’s report forecasts that the sector will grow by 2.0% in 2025 as brands raise prices to protect margins, even as volumes continue to decline.

Free Sample Download sample pages of selected reports Explore a selection of report samples we have handpicked for you. Get a preview of the insights inside. Download your free copy today.

Over the 2024–29 period, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 2.8% and to begin outperforming the broader apparel market from 2028 as the finances of aspirational shoppers improve.

Clothing is projected to be the strongest category through 2029, with a 3.1% CAGR driven by ultra-wealthy consumers who remain willing to spend on trend-led pieces; womenswear is expected to outperform menswear. Accessories – led by luxury handbags as enduring status symbols – should record a 2.9% CAGR. Footwear looks set to be the weakest area, with a modest 1.0% CAGR, as strong demand for trainers from premium and mass-market specialists limits growth for high-end shoe categories.

Asia-Pacific will be the growth engine, posting the strongest regional CAGR of 4.0% between 2024 and 2029, supported by the recovery of China and robust growth in emerging Asian markets. In contrast, Europe and the Americas are forecast to experience softer growth – 1.8% and 1.5% CAGRs respectively – hampered by sluggish economies and the lingering effects of US tariffs. The Middle East and Africa will increase its share of the global market, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates benefiting from tourism and strong domestic spending.

Luxury heavyweights retained power in 2024. Louis Vuitton remained the largest apparel brand, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Hermès was the standout performer, expanding share by 0.7 percentage points to 6.0% as its exclusivity and craftsmanship held strong appeal among the ultra-wealthy. Chanel also gained share, largely through strategic price increases. By contrast, brands such as Gucci and Burberry lost ground amid unclear positioning and weaker product offerings.

Luxury apparel rebound drivers

Several structural factors underpin the recovery outlook. Ultra-wealthy customers continue to provide a stabilising base for top-tier luxury houses, maintaining demand and preserving brand equity. Meanwhile, improvements in broader macroeconomic conditions and rising consumer confidence should gradually bring back aspirational shoppers – the expanding middle and upper-middle segments whose purchasing power was most affected during the downturn.

Social media and influencer marketing are playing an increasingly important role in engaging younger buyers. Luxury brands are courting content creators and leaning into platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to capture Gen Z’s appetite for luxury. Collaborations with celebrities, entertainment franchises and other brands continue to deliver cultural moments that drive excitement and sales.

At the same time, the booming resale market presents both opportunity and challenge. Resale apparel is expected to grow sharply – by nearly 48% between 2024 and 2028 – with luxury items particularly coveted as more affordable options. Some houses have partnered with resale platforms to reclaim share, but secondhand channels remain a threat to full-price sales, especially among budget-conscious aspirational shoppers.

China’s 2024 slowdown – driven in part by its real estate crisis – hit the market hard, and while stimulus should support a recovery in 2025, Chinese shoppers are likely to remain cautious, amplified by government messaging discouraging ostentatious displays of wealth. Online luxury retail also faces challenges: the collapse of major multi-brand platforms in 2024 has reinforced the importance of brick-and-mortar boutiques, where premium service and in-store experience are key to selling high-priced items.
