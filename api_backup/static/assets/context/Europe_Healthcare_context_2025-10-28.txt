[TITLE]Health Canada Grants Authorization for “LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Health Canada has issued a Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) for humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody “LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (early AD) who are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4*) non-carriers or heterozygotes and who have confirmed amyloid pathology. LEQEMBI is the first treatment for early AD that targets an underlying cause of the disease, to be authorized in Canada.

LEQEMBI selectively binds to soluble Aβ aggregates (protofibrils**), as well as insoluble Aβ aggregates (fibrils) which are a major component of Aβ plaques, thereby reducing both Aβ protofibrils and Aβ plaques in the brain. LEQEMBI is the first approved treatment shown to reduce the rate of disease progression and to slow cognitive and functional decline in adults with AD. LEQEMBI is also approved in 51 countries and regions including Japan,1 the United States,2 Europe,3 China,4 South Korea,5 Taiwan,6 and SaudiArabia,7 and applications have been filed in 9 countries.

The approval of LEQEMBI is based on the large global Phase 3 Clarity AD study. In the Clarity AD study, LEQEMBI met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results.8,9 LEQEMBI has been issued market authorization with conditions, pending the results of trials to verify its clinical benefit. Eisai plans to submit clinical assessment data captured from participants in real-world clinical practice.

AD is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80% of all cases.10 As of January 1, 2025, it is estimated there are more than 771,000 patients with dementia in Canada, which is expected to increase to approximately 1 million in 2030 and over 1.7 million in 2050.11 In addition, annual care provided by family and friends for those with dementia is equivalent to 290,000 full-time jobs, which is expected to increase to 690,000 full-time jobs in 2050.11

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with both Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. In Canada, Eisai Limited will distribute the product and conduct information provision activities. Eisai and Biogen are committed to working together with healthcare professionals and other stakeholders towards the early treatment of AD.

* Apolipoprotein E is a protein involved in the metabolism of lipid in humans. It is implicated in AD. People with only one (heterozygous) or no copy (non-carriers) of the ApoE ε4 gene are less likely to experience ARIA than people with two ApoE ε4 copies (homozygous).12

** Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.13 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.14

[TITLE]Northwest Biotherapeutics Announces That Its Acquisition of Advent BioServices Ltd. Has Closed:
[TEXT]
BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB:NWBO) (the "Company" or "NWBio"), a biotechnology company developing DCVax® personalized immune therapies for solid tumor cancers, announced that its acquisition of Advent BioServices Ltd. ("Advent") has closed. As a result of this acquisition, Advent is now a wholly owned subsidiary of NWBio.

The Company anticipates that this acquisition will help enable efficiencies and scale-up of operations. The Company believes that integration of the companies can result in:

A fully integrated platform combining the technologies, expertise and intellectual property of NWBio, Advent and Flaskworks;

Streamlining and efficiencies in supply chain management and facilities management;

Closing of operations at the GMP facility in London and reallocation of resources to the Sawston, UK facility and to capacity development in the US;

Facilitating scale-up of manufacturing capacity;

Streamlining and efficiencies in interactions with clinical sites and distribution of DCVax products.

As previously announced, through the acquisition of Advent, NWBio is receiving all of Advent's fixed assets, including extensive cryostorage and other equipment purchased by Advent over the last several years. Intellectual property and other intangibles that Advent had acquired are also included.

The Company is not issuing any shares or other securities in connection with acquiring Advent. On the contrary, 19 million NWBio securities (13.5 million shares and 5.5 million options) that were previously issued to Advent as payment for contract services are reverting back to the Company along with the acquisition of the other Advent assets.

The consideration for the acquisition will be paid in installments over two years, with potential acceleration after regulatory approval of the Company's DCVax®-L product. The consideration consists of a payment of £1.4 million and payment of the net amount of accounts payable ("Net AP") already due from the Company to Advent for services under existing contracts. The acquisition agreement was updated to provide that the installment payments will not begin until 90 days after the October closing, rather than 90 days after the August agreement, and the Net AP is likewise being determined as of the closing date.

"We are excited to have completed the necessary conditions for closing the acquisition of Advent, and to be moving into position for potential significant scale-up," commented Linda Powers, the Company's CEO. "We believe this integration can also help accelerate development of additional applications and next-generation versions of our technologies, applying the combined expertise and the large portfolio of intellectual property that we have amassed. We believe this represents important progress in building a dominant franchise."

[TITLE]Biogen Licenses Oral C5aR1 Antagonist from Vanqua Bio to Expand Immunology Portfolio:
[TEXT]
The oral C5aR1 antagonist is designed to modulate neutrophil-driven inflammation, a central mechanism underlying many inflammatory diseases

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and CHICAGO, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Vanqua Bio today announced a license agreement granting Biogen exclusive worldwide rights to Vanqua’s preclinical, oral C5aR1 antagonist. This agreement strengthens Biogen’s immunology strategy by advancing a proven immune mechanism with the potential to address a broad range of inflammatory disorders with high unmet need.

“This agreement reflects our strong commitment to building a comprehensive immunology pipeline with a strategic focus on both innate and adaptive immune pathways,” said Jane Grogan, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research at Biogen. “C5aR1 is a well-validated target involved in neutrophil-mediated inflammation, which plays a central role across a range of inflammatory disorders. Advancing this program enables us to deepen our scientific and clinical focus in immunological diseases where we believe Biogen can make a meaningful difference for patients.”

This agreement complements Biogen’s early-stage immunology pipeline by adding an oral mechanism with potential applicability across multiple immune-mediated diseases. C5aR1 plays a pivotal role in driving critical components of the immune cascade involved in tissue inflammation, particularly in neutrophil-mediated conditions. Preclinically, the program has demonstrated inhibition of complement activation of pathogenic immune cells, and a preclinical safety and tolerability profile supportive of advancing the compound into clinical development. Biogen would expect, if results continue to be supportive, to file an IND in 2027.

“Biogen’s scale, development rigor, and global commercialization capabilities make them uniquely positioned to advance this compound for patients with inflammatory disorders,” said Jim Sullivan, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vanqua Bio. “The discovery of a highly differentiated C5aR1 inhibitor validates the small molecule drug discovery capabilities of the Vanqua team. Furthermore, this transaction allows Vanqua to remain focused on our CNS pipeline while ensuring that this program can be developed to its full potential.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen will obtain exclusive worldwide rights to Vanqua’s peripherally-directed C5aR1 program. Vanqua will receive a $70 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $990 million in potential development, regulatory, commercial, and sales milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on potential net sales. The upfront payment will be recorded by Biogen as an Acquired In-Process Research and Development expense in the fourth quarter of 2025. Biogen will lead all future development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts.
