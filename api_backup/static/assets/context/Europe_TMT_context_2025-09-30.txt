[TITLE]EU member states back calls for Chips Act changes:
[TEXT]
Momentum is gathering behind calls for a Chips Act 2.0 to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in the semiconductor sector amid growing geopolitical uncertainty over global markets and supply chains.

The Semicon Coalition, a group now composed of all 27 EU member states, has signed a declaration [PDF] setting out its goal for a stronger Chips Act to bolster Europe's position in the global semiconductor industry.

It follows earlier calls from European chipmakers to look beyond the Chips Act and do more to support other areas of the sector, not just manufacturing, while the European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA) also previously said it would like to see more public funding and greater input on decisions.

In response, the European Commission says it is already conducting an evaluation and review of the initiative, and opened a public consultation and call for evidence earlier this month. Those with an interest in the sector are invited to share their views on how the Chips Act is performing today and how it should be adapted.

The declaration says a revised version of the strategy must address Europe's vulnerabilities, and aim to make its chip industries stronger in response to geopolitical, technological, and environmental challenges. This is to build on existing strengths as well as emerging market opportunities highlighted in the Draghi report on European competitiveness.

Those challenges include volatility with America - the Trump administration is using every trick it can think of to force tech companies to dance to its tune - and China's attempts to push chipmakers in other countries out of business by flooding the global market with cheap subsidized products.

However, on the strategic objectives for an updated silicon initiative, the declaration says the amibiton to achieve 20 percent share of the global semiconductor market by 2030 is currently unachievable – something many critics had already pointed out – because it lacks clear strategic direction on where and why Europe should lead in the semiconductor supply chain.

Instead, a revised Chips Act 2.0 must be "grounded" in three overall objectives: enabling a competitive European semiconductor ecosystem that can deliver prosperity; developing technological leadership at critical points in the supply chain; and building a stable and reliable supply of trustworthy semiconductors for Europe's critical industrial sectors.

These objectives need to be backed up by measurable targets, periodically reviewed by the European Commission working with member states and relevant stakeholders in the semiconductor ecosystem, the declaration proposes.

A long list of policy priorities is identified, most of which can be grouped into creating a strong ecosystem within Europe, ensuring enough funding, and developing a workforce with the right skills.

The latter would involve support for greater collaboration between academic institutions in the EU, with the establishment of a European Chips Skills Program. Fostering collaboration between industries across Europe and boosting R&D efforts all the way up to first deployment of a particular technology, are also part of the mix.

Funding suggestions include aligning national and European-level finance streams, as well as encouraging private capital to back up the public money.

Also mentioned are issues that hold back construction of new industrial infrastructure: permits, grid access, power supply, and other preconditions.

"We will explore emergency permitting legislation to fast-track strategic investments in the semiconductor ecosystem," the declaration states, echoing similar measures being implemented in the US and UK to allow projects seen as vital to side-step the usual planning checks.

The declaration issues a call to action, saying the signatories are ready to work with the European Commission on a revision of the Chips Act that will drive the development of a stronger local sector.

"Together, we can out-innovate, out-compete, and out-perform," it says rather optimistically, "ensuring Europe's leadership in the critical technologies that will define our future."

Luis Fernandes, IDC Senior Research Manager for EMEA Digital Infrastructure Strategies, said that a review is quite normal for this type of initiative since it has reached its two-year anniversary.

"That being said, it is hard to classify the first iteration of the European Chips Act as a resounding success," he told The Register.

"The first Act was focused on a limited number of projects. This next iteration has the potential to enlist other member states that might want to partake in this endeavor and expand the capabilities and resilience of the initiative," he added.

The Semicon Coalition was formed earlier this year, initially composed of Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands.

In a published statement, Minister Vincent Karremans of Economic Affairs for The Netherlands said: "Today all EU Ministers agreed on the fact that Europe's industrial strategy should adapt to the increasing geopolitical tensions in the world. This unique unity is a landmark step forward in securing future strategic autonomy and broad prosperity."

Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Enterprise in the Irish government, said: "This morning I am proud to stand with my European colleagues in endorsing the Declaration of the European Semiconductor Coalition. And I join with them in calling for a revitalized European Chips Act to secure Europe's place at the forefront of the global semiconductor industry."

"This is Europe's moment to align national ambitions with a shared vision: to build a semiconductor ecosystem which secures our sovereignty, drives innovation while ensuring prosperity for generations to come."

Gaurav Gupta, VP Analyst in Gartner's Emerging Trends and Technologies team, said that Chips Act 2.0 needs to better define the end goal.

"The original plan of 20 percent market share was too optimistic and broad – I would say it was rather vague. Once there is a better understanding of what the EU wants to achieve with 2.0, it should channel resources in the right direction. Then it would be a matter of execution," he told us.

Where the original act largely just followed what the US and China were doing, the EU should play to its strengths, Gupta believes, such as in research, automotive and industrial chips, emerging energy-efficient technologies, and wafer fabrication tech (think ASML).

"The EU doesn't have the same resources that China and US have with regards to investing in and leading in advanced semiconductor process nodes. It must rather rely on collaboration for certain aspects, while ensuring better utilization of its own resources.

"Another challenge [the] EU has is that with many participating nations drafting these policies, rather than crisp decision making, it can fall into the trap of interests that serve a particular entity. [The] EU needs to overcome those issues and be quick and aggressive." ®

Olimpiu Pop: Hello everybody. I'm Olimpiu Pop, an InfoQ editor, and today I have in front of me Brian Fox, CTO and co-founder of Sonatype. Hello, Brian. If you can introduce yourself, I know that you are very involved with open source, so I'll allow you to choose the accolades that you want to bear, as you have plenty.

Brian Fox: Sure, sure. Thanks. Thanks for having me. So, yes, I'm Brian Fox, as you mentioned, co-founder and CTO at Sonatype. If you haven't heard of Sonatype, Sonatype runs the Maven Central Repository. We're also the producers of Nexus and a lot of other software that people tend to know. I got started in open source a long time ago.

Most of my open source street credentials come from the Maven project. I was a contributor early on. I was the PMC chair for several years. I'm still on the PMC, but I haven't written any code there in a while. I work with the Apache Infrared to run some of that stuff. And more recently, I've been on the governing board of the Open Source Security Foundation, the OpenSSF, and I'm also on the board of the FINOS, Financial Open Source Foundation. And through those efforts in recent years, I have worked with various governments, contributing to some of the national cybersecurity drafts. Over the last couple of years, I have also been involved in cyber resiliency and CRA work in Europe. So that's what I've been up to.

Is the EU Cyber Resiliency Act in its final form good for Open Source? [01:42]

Olimpiu Pop: Thank you for the help with the CRA. You were pretty involved with that. You are one of the people who pushed and rang the alarm when you felt that the open source in Europe, at least, is in danger. How

[TITLE]Finland government tax proposal worries datacentre investors:
[TEXT]
Finland’s long-term ambition to position itself as the most attractive low-cost Nordic cold climate hub for datacentres could be derailed in the wake of a budget proposal by the Finnish government to eliminate energy tax breaks provided to the sector.

The Ministry of Finance (MoF), which is tasked with amending the Energy Taxation Act to remove the tax breaks for datacentres in the 2026 budget, justified the action as being part of a wider tax reform focused on all core sectors of business and industry.

Finance minister Riikka Purra told the Eduskunta (national parliament) in August that the MoF is on course to finalise the budget’s tax reform provisions by the end of October. The MoF said the tax breaks provided to the datacentre sector are projected to be worth a total of €50m in 2025.

Although the MoF could, from a legislative standpoint, abolish the tax break for datacentres by adding an amendment to the existing Energy Taxation Act, it will be mindful of the repercussions and fall-out from such an action. The removal of tax breaks could significantly impact the country’s ability to not only lure new datacentre investments, but may also dissuade companies already operating facilities in Finland from planning expansion.

Blunt response The data sector’s response to Finland’s tax reform proposal was blunt and immediate. XTX Markets, the London-based algorithmic trading company, warned that it was re-evaluating a €1bn investment to build a mega-sized datacentre in Finland. Michael Irwin, XTX’s chief operating officer, said it had placed its long-term investment roadmap for Finland under review “due to the proposed changes in electricity taxation”. The MoF’s tax reform deliberations are being closely watched by global companies like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and IBM, all of which have invested heavily in Finland’s fast-growing datacentre sector. Other interested investors, including private equity groups and hedge funds, are also monitoring the MoF’s future actions. The government proposal under review by the MoF includes the abolition of electricity tax breaks for datacentres, together with an amendment to change the energy rate charged to the sector’s facilities from its current low level of €0.0006 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to the standard Finnish industry rate of €0.0225/kWh. In addition, the MoF is also reviewing a separate advantage available to datacentre operators that provides accelerated depreciation allowances to new build projects. This provision allows for the write-off of capital investments at a greater speed for companies, offering datacentre builders and operators the opportunity to boost early-stage cash flow. The MoF is collaborating on the proposed tax reform bill with the Ministry of Employment and Economy. Together, the two ministries are working to prepare a new and broader tax model that will alter how datacentres are taxed in the future.

Silver lining? A possible silver lining for datacentre operators and investors comes in the form of a September statement by finance minister Purra that the MoF is open to applying specific tax rates to different types of datacentres depending on their size and energy usage. Purra said a redefinition of datacentres for tax purposes, against the backdrop of a government plan to conduct a wider cross-industry tax appraisal, was “overdue”. The uncertainty shadowing the government’s tax reform proposal will hinder the country’s ability to attract new datacentre capital investment projects, said Jouni Salonen, a senior advisor at Business Finland, the state agency for trade and investment promotion. “As long as the taxation issue remains unclear, it is difficult to contemplate any investment decisions being made. The electricity tax has such a significant impact on the operational costs of datacentres that decisions are difficult to make in this situation,” said Salonen, who leads Business Finland’s communications, mobility, software and datacentre department. Finland’s tax reform deliberations are taking place alongside a separate initiative by the Orpo government to appoint Veli-Matti Mattila, a technology industry career professional, to produce a national roadmap to evaluate the role of datacentres in the greater Finnish economy. Mattila, a former chief executive of the Finnish telecom group Elisa, is expected to present the datacentres national roadmap report in November 2025. The mission tasked to Mattila involves a deep dive into the positives and negatives of having a substantial datacentre presence in a small-sized European economy like Finland. The Mattila-headed national roadmap analysis, which will also examine taxation around tax centres, sets out to scrutinise the advantages and challenges of developing Finland as a major Nordic hub. The final report will examine the impact of a large datacentre presence on key areas of economic concern, including the sector’s effect on energy production, consumption and prices. The Mattila report will also investigate the state’s future role as both a legislator and “stakeholder-investor”. This is to ensure that increased industry demands for electricity are met by forward-planning and cost-efficient capital investment schemes that can match production to future demand by scaling up supply capacity.

[TITLE]EU, Japan trust they have secured limits to US drug tariffs:
[TEXT]
By Philip Blenkinsop

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union and Japan expressed confidence on Friday that they had secured limits on U.S. tariffs on pharmaceuticals, which President Donald Trump said he would impose next week at a rate of 100%.

The European Commission referred to a joint statement agreed with the U.S. following its end-July trade deal, which states that the tariff for pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber would not exceed 15%.

"This clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators," a Commission spokesperson said.

CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM THAT CAP WILL APPLY

European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, speaking in Hanoi, said he expected the commitment to be respected, noting that Washington had followed through in lowering car tariffs.

Japan also referred to its joint statement with Washington, which said that U.S. tariff rates on Japanese semiconductors and pharmaceuticals would not exceed those applied to others such as the EU.

A lobbyist for a major drugmaker with large European exports to the United States said Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on branded drug imports was worrying, but the industry hoped the 15% rate agreed under the U.S.-EU trade deal would apply.

"Nothing is clear yet but we hope the EU-U.S. deal stands," the lobbyist said.

The EU's pharma lobby group, EFPIA, said it was working on the assumption that the EU-U.S. deal applied and that it was still pushing on exemptions for medicines.

Europe and the U.S. have tightly linked medicine supply chains, with Ireland, Switzerland and Germany among top exporters.

EU medicinal and pharmaceutical exports to the United States totalled 119.7 billion euros ($134.0 billion) in 2024, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat, some 37% worth from Ireland.

In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump announced a fresh round of tariffs that also covered trucks at 25% and furniture at 30-50%.

Trump said the pharmaceutical tariff of 100% would apply to branded or patented drugs unless a given pharmaceutical company was building a manufacturing plant in the United States.

A source at a large European drugmaker said the company was quietly optimistic it would avoid 100% tariffs given the major U.S. investments it has pledged this year.

Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said on Friday it was uncertain how the 100% tariff decision aligned with the EU-U.S. trade deal. The Danish maker of weight-loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic said it exported more active pharmaceutical ingredients from the U.S. than it imported.

[TITLE]Europe Online Travel Market Report 2025: Market to Reach US$ 560 Billion by 2033 at 11.22% CAGR, Driven by Rise in Digital Bookings, Demand for Mobile-first Platforms, Personalized Recommendations:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Europe Online Travel Market to Reach US$ 560 Billion by 2033 - 11.22% CAGR Forecast (2025-2033)" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Europe Online Travel Market is expected to reach US$ 560 billion by 2033 from US$ 215.05 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 11.22% from 2025 to 2033.

Increased digital bookings, a growing demand for mobile-first platforms, a rise in personalized AI-driven recommendations, the adoption of virtual payment solutions, a focus on sustainable tourism, regulatory developments, and the incorporation of immersive technologies like augmented reality for improved travel experiences are all contributing factors to the growth of the online travel market share in Europe.

Over the past ten years, the online travel sector in Europe has grown remarkably thanks to rising internet usage, smartphone adoption, and changing consumer habits. When purchasing flights, hotels, vacation packages, and rental cars, European tourists are increasingly choosing digital platforms because they want simplicity, affordable prices, and individualized experiences.

Furthermore, by providing transparency and smooth user experiences, the growth of metasearch engines, online travel agencies (OTAs), and aggregators like Booking.com, Expedia, and Skyscanner has revolutionized the booking industry.

The European internet travel market is significantly shaped by technological innovation. Travel platforms may offer customized promos, dynamic pricing, and personalized suggestions thanks to advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. These days, mobile apps play a key role in the consumer journey, helping with everything from real-time schedule updates to trip planning.

Users can virtually explore destinations before making a reservation thanks to the growing popularity of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. Additionally, blockchain adoption is becoming a viable way to lower fraud and enhance payment security. In accordance with regional aspirations for environmental responsibility, internet portals are highlighting eco-friendly lodging and carbon offset possibilities as a result of European consumers' growing interest in sustainable travel.

Booking patterns in the online travel industry are being influenced by European tourists' growing emphasis on sustainability and immersive experiences. Because environmentally conscious tourists are looking for low-impact travel options, carbon-neutral flights, and green-certified lodging, online travel agencies (OTAs) are implementing sustainability filters and eco-friendly travel packages.

For example, only 10% of European travelers expect to reduce their travel budgets in 2025, while 53% want to increase their spending compared to 2024, per a report released by Accor on December 2, 2024. According to 73% of participants in the study, which surveyed 8,000 travelers across seven European countries, climate change and eco-friendly travel options are important factors. Furthermore, 90% of respondents stated that overtourism-related concerns would influence their travel choices in 2025.

Key Factors Driving the Europe Online Travel Market Growth

Growing Internet and Smartphone Penetration

One of the main factors propelling the expansion of the online travel market in Europe has been the swift rise in high-speed internet access and smartphone usage. More customers now have the means to look for, evaluate, and reserve travel services straight from their smartphones at any time or location. Younger generations, who value digital interaction and mobile-first experiences, will find this convenience especially appealing.

Improved internet infrastructure, such as the widely used 4G and expanding 5G networks, facilitates quick app loads and seamless operation, increasing customer happiness. Additionally, booking procedures have been made simpler by mobile-friendly websites and specialized travel apps, which lowers friction and promotes impromptu travel planning. With improved access in rural and previously underserved areas, the digital divide is closing and the potential user base for online travel services is growing.

Shifting Customer Preferences

When compared to traditional travel firms, European tourists are favoring online travel platforms for their flexibility and transparency. Users are empowered to make educated selections on their own by using online portals to quickly compare costs, read reviews, personalize itineraries, and access real-time availability.

The user experience is improved by the ease of reserving several travel-related items in one location, such as hotels, flights, and rental cars. Customers also appreciate dynamic pricing and personalized offers that are based on their browsing habits and interests, which are offered by many online platforms through the use of AI and data analytics.

Peer reviews and social media also have a big impact on buying decisions, which makes digital platforms more alluring. All things considered, the move toward independent trip planning is consistent with larger lifestyle trends that place an emphasis on immediacy, choice, and control.

Growth of Low-Cost Airlines and Transportation Options

International trade policy and geopolitical changes have a big impact on the wheat market in Europe. Global grain supply chains have been disrupted by events like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has forced the European Union to modify its trade policies. Variable tariffs, import quotas, and export limitations have changed sourcing habits and made regional wheat production more important.

In order to maintain domestic supply and benefit from competitive price, this environment has led European growers to expand their crop. Furthermore, policy changes aimed at preserving food sovereignty are being encouraged by changing ties with important trading partners and market instability worldwide. These factors put Europe in a position to solidify its position as a dependable supplier of wheat in international markets by posing both difficulties and chances for expansion.

Challenges in the Europe Online Travel Market

Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Issues

The dangers associated with data privacy and cybersecurity have significantly increased as the European online travel market depends more and more on digital platforms for reservations, payments, and consumer data management. vacation agencies are prime targets for cyberattacks and data breaches because they gather sensitive personal data, such as payment information, passport details, and vacation itineraries.

Strict laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU must be followed, but doing so is difficult and necessitates constant investment in security infrastructure and employee education. Any data breach or improper handling can result in heavy fines and seriously erode customer trust.

In order to protect customer data and preserve their reputations, travel agencies must constantly improve their cybersecurity protocols, implement cutting-edge encryption technologies, and uphold clear privacy policies.

Expectations for Customer Service

When planning and organizing their vacations online, modern tourists anticipate smooth, instantaneous customer support. Travelers want quick assistance through chatbots, call centers, or social media channels because travel plans are becoming more complicated and changing frequently due to things like flight delays or health regulations.

However, many online travel platforms still struggle to provide consistently high-quality service at scale. While human support might be expensive and challenging to scale internationally, automated methods might not always be able to handle complicated problems. Unhappy customers, bad reviews, and a decline in brand loyalty can result from subpar customer service.

Businesses must make investments in omnichannel communication plans, sophisticated AI-driven customer support tools, and skilled support staff that can effectively and efficiently handle a range of traveler needs if they want to stay competitive.

[TITLE]Finland government tax proposal worries datacentre investors:
[TEXT]
Finland’s long-term ambition to position itself as the most attractive low-cost Nordic cold climate hub for datacentres could be derailed in the wake of a budget proposal by the Finnish government to eliminate energy tax breaks provided to the sector.

The Ministry of Finance (MoF), which is tasked with amending the Energy Taxation Act to remove the tax breaks for datacentres in the 2026 budget, justified the action as being part of a wider tax reform focused on all core sectors of business and industry.

Finance minister Riikka Purra told the Eduskunta (national parliament) in August that the MoF is on course to finalise the budget’s tax reform provisions by the end of October. The MoF said the tax breaks provided to the datacentre sector are projected to be worth a total of €50m in 2025.

Although the MoF could, from a legislative standpoint, abolish the tax break for datacentres by adding an amendment to the existing Energy Taxation Act, it will be mindful of the repercussions and fall-out from such an action. The removal of tax breaks could significantly impact the country’s ability to not only lure new datacentre investments, but may also dissuade companies already operating facilities in Finland from planning expansion.

Blunt response The data sector’s response to Finland’s tax reform proposal was blunt and immediate. XTX Markets, the London-based algorithmic trading company, warned that it was re-evaluating a €1bn investment to build a mega-sized datacentre in Finland. Michael Irwin, XTX’s chief operating officer, said it had placed its long-term investment roadmap for Finland under review “due to the proposed changes in electricity taxation”. The MoF’s tax reform deliberations are being closely watched by global companies like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and IBM, all of which have invested heavily in Finland’s fast-growing datacentre sector. Other interested investors, including private equity groups and hedge funds, are also monitoring the MoF’s future actions. The government proposal under review by the MoF includes the abolition of electricity tax breaks for datacentres, together with an amendment to change the energy rate charged to the sector’s facilities from its current low level of €0.0006 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to the standard Finnish industry rate of €0.0225/kWh. In addition, the MoF is also reviewing a separate advantage available to datacentre operators that provides accelerated depreciation allowances to new build projects. This provision allows for the write-off of capital investments at a greater speed for companies, offering datacentre builders and operators the opportunity to boost early-stage cash flow. The MoF is collaborating on the proposed tax reform bill with the Ministry of Employment and Economy. Together, the two ministries are working to prepare a new and broader tax model that will alter how datacentres are taxed in the future.

Silver lining? A possible silver lining for datacentre operators and investors comes in the form of a September statement by finance minister Purra that the MoF is open to applying specific tax rates to different types of datacentres depending on their size and energy usage. Purra said a redefinition of datacentres for tax purposes, against the backdrop of a government plan to conduct a wider cross-industry tax appraisal, was “overdue”. The uncertainty shadowing the government’s tax reform proposal will hinder the country’s ability to attract new datacentre capital investment projects, said Jouni Salonen, a senior advisor at Business Finland, the state agency for trade and investment promotion. “As long as the taxation issue remains unclear, it is difficult to contemplate any investment decisions being made. The electricity tax has such a significant impact on the operational costs of datacentres that decisions are difficult to make in this situation,” said Salonen, who leads Business Finland’s communications, mobility, software and datacentre department. Finland’s tax reform deliberations are taking place alongside a separate initiative by the Orpo government to appoint Veli-Matti Mattila, a technology industry career professional, to produce a national roadmap to evaluate the role of datacentres in the greater Finnish economy. Mattila, a former chief executive of the Finnish telecom group Elisa, is expected to present the datacentres national roadmap report in November 2025. The mission tasked to Mattila involves a deep dive into the positives and negatives of having a substantial datacentre presence in a small-sized European economy like Finland. The Mattila-headed national roadmap analysis, which will also examine taxation around tax centres, sets out to scrutinise the advantages and challenges of developing Finland as a major Nordic hub. The final report will examine the impact of a large datacentre presence on key areas of economic concern, including the sector’s effect on energy production, consumption and prices. The Mattila report will also investigate the state’s future role as both a legislator and “stakeholder-investor”. This is to ensure that increased industry demands for electricity are met by forward-planning and cost-efficient capital investment schemes that can match production to future demand by scaling up supply capacity.
