Schoenefeld/Berlin, Germany, November 17, 2025 --- Captain T Cell, a biotechnology company developing next-generation TCR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, today announced the successful closing of an equity financing round with both new and existing investors. The latest equity funding, along with already secured grants, provides Captain T Cell with a total budget of EUR 20 million to advance its best-in-class autologous program CTC127 to clinical Phase I read-outs and its first-in-class allogeneic program for off-the-shelf solid tumor treatments towards clinical trial readiness.

The round was led by Springboard Health Angels and Pluton Asset Holding AG, joined by Sintra Limited and Technologiegründerfonds Sachsen, as well as existing investors i&i Biotech Fund, HIL-INVENT and Brandenburg Kapital.

The funds will enable the Company´s lead program CTC127 to progress into a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial (TOMATA - “Toolbox-modified MAGE-A4-TCR-T cell therapy for HLA-A1”). The trial will be led by principal investigator Prof. Antonia Busse, Charité – Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, with participation from eight other leading cancer centers across Germany. The study will enroll patients with multiple advanced MAGE-A4-positive solid tumor indications, including lung, bladder, gastroesophageal, ovarian, and head and neck cancers. CTC127 is based on the Company’s proprietary and versatile engineering toolbox, which enables functional “armoring” of T cells to enhance their anti-tumor activity, persistence, and resilience within the solid tumor microenvironment.

In parallel, the Company has already demonstrated complete solid tumor responses in vivo with a program leveraging its first-in-class allogeneic TCR-T cell platform and will advance it toward clinical trial readiness. Furthermore, the Company plans to extend its proprietary best-in-class toolbox towards in vivo T cell therapy applications.

“Despite a challenging fundraising environment, we have gained broad investor support, which underscores the strong competitive profile of Captain T Cell’s best- and first-in-class next-generation T cell therapy platform and enables us to advance these therapies for the benefit of cancer patients,” said Dr. Felix Lorenz, CEO of Captain T Cell. “Our best-in-class autologous program CTC127 will enter the fully funded TOMATA clinical trial and our first-in-class allogeneic TCR-T platform is progressing toward clinical readiness. We are optimistic that our best-in-class toolbox technologies will be clinically validated in the upcoming trial and subsequently expanded into off-the-shelf approaches.”

“We are excited to co-lead this recent financing round of Captain T Cell,” said Dr. Andreas Schmidt of Springboard Health Angels. “The Company´s lead program CTC127 holds the potential to become a highly effective and safe therapy for solid tumor patients who urgently need novel treatment options. With funding secured through the upcoming Phase I readout, Captain T Cell is well positioned for a major value inflection.”

Dr. Theis Terwey, representing lead investor Pluton Asset Holding AG, commented: “MAGE-A4 is a de-risked and commercially validated target. The available preclinical data convincingly demonstrate that Captain T Cell’s toolbox-enhanced approach is conceptually superior to on-market cell therapies against solid tumors, providing strong evidence that the Company can deliver competitive efficacy in large solid tumor indications.”

Dr. Barbora Šumová, Investment Director at i&i Biotech Fund, added: “Since our initial investment, the Captain T Cell team has consistently executed with exceptional speed and quality, achieving every milestone set at the seed round funding stage. We are proud to continue supporting the Company as it advances towards becoming a clinical-stage company.”

Prof. Antonia Busse, Principal Investigator at Charité – Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, noted: “There remains a profound unmet need for effective therapies for patients with advanced solid tumors. We look forward to initiating the clinical safety and efficacy evaluation of CTC127 together with eight other leading cancer centers in Germany.”

The round was led by Springboard Health Angels and Pluton Asset Holding AG, joined by Sintra Limited and Technologiegründerfonds Sachsen, as well as existing investors i&i Biotech Fund, HIL-INVENT and Brandenburg Kapital.

The funds will enable the Company´s lead program CTC127 to progress into a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial (TOMATA - “Toolbox-modified MAGE-A4-TCR-T cell therapy for HLA-A1”). The trial will be led by principal investigator Prof. Antonia Busse, Charité – Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, with participation from eight other leading cancer centers across Germany. The study will enroll patients with multiple advanced MAGE-A4-positive solid tumor indications, including lung, bladder, gastroesophageal, ovarian, and head and neck cancers. CTC127 is based on the Company’s proprietary and versatile engineering toolbox, which enables functional “armoring” of T cells to enhance their anti-tumor activity, persistence, and resilience within the solid tumor microenvironment.

In parallel, the Company has already demonstrated complete solid tumor responses in vivo with a program leveraging its first-in-class allogeneic TCR-T cell platform and will advance it toward clinical trial readiness. Furthermore, the Company plans to extend its proprietary best-in-class toolbox towards in vivo T cell therapy applications.

“Despite a challenging fundraising environment, we have gained broad investor support, which underscores the strong competitive profile of Captain T Cell’s best- and first-in-class next-generation T cell therapy platform and enables us to advance these therapies for the benefit of cancer patients,” said Dr. Felix Lorenz, CEO of Captain T Cell. “Our best-in-class autologous program CTC127 will enter the fully funded TOMATA clinical trial and our first-in-class allogeneic TCR-T platform is progressing toward clinical readiness. We are optimistic that our best-in-class toolbox technologies will be clinically validated in the upcoming trial and subsequently expanded into off-the-shelf approaches.”

“We are excited to co-lead this recent financing round of Captain T Cell,” said Dr. Andreas Schmidt of Springboard Health Angels. “The Company´s lead program CTC127 holds the potential to become a highly effective and safe therapy for solid tumor patients who urgently need novel treatment options. With funding secured through the upcoming Phase I readout, Captain T Cell is well positioned for a major value inflection.”

Dr. Theis Terwey, representing lead investor Pluton Asset Holding AG, commented: “MAGE-A4 is a de-risked and commercially validated target. The available preclinical data convincingly demonstrate that Captain T Cell’s toolbox-enhanced approach is conceptually superior to on-market cell therapies against solid tumors, providing strong evidence that the Company can deliver competitive efficacy in large solid tumor indications.”

Dr. Barbora Šumová, Investment Director at i&i Biotech Fund, added: “Since our initial investment, the Captain T Cell team has consistently executed with exceptional speed and quality, achieving every milestone set at the seed round funding stage. We are proud to continue supporting the Company as it advances towards becoming a clinical-stage company.”

Prof. Antonia Busse, Principal Investigator at Charité – Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, noted: “There remains a profound unmet need for effective therapies for patients with advanced solid tumors. We look forward to initiating the clinical safety and efficacy evaluation of CTC127 together with eight other leading cancer centers in Germany.”

[TITLE]Northwest Biotherapeutics Announces That Construction Activities Are Under Way For the First Grade C Manufacturing Suite in the Sawston, UK Facility:
[TEXT]
BETHESDA, Md., Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest Biotherapeutics (OTCQB:NWBO) (the "Company" or "NWBio"), a biotechnology company developing DCVax® personalized immune therapies for solid tumor cancers, announced that it has engaged a construction firm to carry out the construction of the first Grade C manufacturing suite in the Company's Sawston, UK facility, the construction firm is onsite and the construction activities have begun. The Company anticipates that the manufacturing capacity of the first Grade C suite will more than double the aggregate capacity of the existing Grade B manufacturing suites combined. As such, the Company considers the construction of the first Grade C suite a major step towards potential large scale-up of the Company's production of DCVax® products.

Manufacturing of medical products such as DCVax must be done in clean room facilities in sterile conditions. When manufacturing equipment and procedures involve steps open to the air, the manufacturing must take place in Grade B suites with special air handling and other requirements which are extremely expensive both to develop and to operate. In addition, only one patient's product may be made in a Grade B suite at a time, and the whole suite must stop activity and be specially cleaned in between manufacturing one patient's product and the next. The manufacturing of living cell products in general has traditionally had to be conducted in Grade B suites.

When a medical product is able to be manufactured using closed equipment and procedures that are not open to the air, the manufacturing can be conducted in Grade C manufacturing suites which are much less onerous and expensive to operate. In addition, multiple or numerous patient products may be manufactured simultaneously in a single Grade C manufacturing, and only certain equipment (not the whole suite) must be cleaned between production batches. These differences can enable a major increase in throughput and capacity, together with efficiency gains in both staff and materials.

As the Company has previously reported, the Flaskworks system is specially designed to carry out the key manufacturing processes for DCVax-L products on a closed basis. Developing this system was particularly challenging because the DCVax-L manufacturing process includes the dendritic cells adhering like barnacles to the flasks containing them, and then the mature activated cells being harvested by detaching them without damaging or destroying them. The Company views use of the Flaskworks closed system as key to enabling DCVax-L production to begin taking place in Grade C suites rather than Grade B suites – and the Company views such transition to Grade C suites as central to large scale-up of production.

The Company's business plan currently envisions manufacturing being established in the Grade C suite in the Sawston facility during Q2 of next year, with the construction of the Grade C suite taking approximately 6 months, followed by equipment installation and validation.

As previously reported, Advent worked closely with construction and engineering experts to develop a design and location within the Sawston facility that is expected to enable this first Grade C manufacturing suite to be constructed on a simplified basis at significantly lower construction costs and faster timeline. The project will also involve several million pounds of equipment costs. For example, as noted in the Company's recent 10-Q report, the cost to purchase certain fundamental equipment new is
