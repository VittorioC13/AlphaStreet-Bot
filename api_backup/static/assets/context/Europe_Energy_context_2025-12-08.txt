EU launches $3.5 billion initiative to break China’s grip on critical minerals

The EU is launching a €3 billion initiative called RESourceEU to break its heavy reliance on China for critical raw materials. Currently, China supplies nearly all of Europe's rare earth elements and magnets, which are essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy and defense systems.

This move is part of a broader, more assertive EU economic security strategy. It aims to protect against the "weaponization" of trade by utilizing tools such as screening foreign investments and strengthening key industries to prevent supply chain disruptions.

The strategy involves more than just funding. It plans to fast-track mining permits, enable joint purchasing of materials by EU countries, boost recycling to keep materials in Europe and create a central office to oversee these efforts.

The EU has set clear goals to reduce its dependency on China by 2030. For example, it aims to cut reliance on Chinese rare earth extraction from 95% to 42%, and on processing from 100% to 60%.

The EU will start by gently encouraging companies to diversify their supply chains away from China, with the implied threat of future legislation if they do not comply. This effort is closely linked to the bloc's goals of strengthening its defense industry and supporting Ukraine.

In a decisive move to secure its industrial future, the European Union (EU) has unveiled a major funding initiative and a new strategic doctrine aimed at drastically reducing its dependency on China for the vital earth metals that power everything from electric vehicles to wind turbines and defense systems.

The bloc's executive arm, the European Commission, announced that it will release approximately €3 billion ($3.5 billion) next year to finance projects that diversify Europe’s supply of critical raw materials. This funding is the cornerstone of a new initiative named RESourceEU, modeled on the successful REPowerEU plan that helped wean Europe off Russian energy.

The urgency of the plan is underscored by stark statistics. As explained by BrightU.AI's Enoch AI engine, the EU currently relies on China for 90% of its permanent magnets, 95% of its extracted rare earth elements and a full 100% of its rare earth processing and recycling. These materials are indispensable for the green and digital transitions, making this dependency a significant economic security risk.

"Our goal is to prevent short-term disruptions, while steadily reducing risky dependencies and avoiding new ones," stated European Commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic, highlighting concerns over the weaponization of trade and state-backed overcapacities.

The newly outlined economic security strategy marks a "more proactive" stance from Brussels. It involves maximizing existing trade tools and creating new ones across six priority areas, including screening foreign investments, strengthening key industries and protecting critical infrastructure.

The RESourceEU initiative goes beyond just funding

The RESourceEU initiative's multi-pronged approach includes:

Fast-tracking projects – Cutting bureaucratic red tape to accelerate permits for mining and processing ventures.

– Cutting bureaucratic red tape to accelerate permits for mining and processing ventures. Joint action – Facilitating the joint purchasing and stockpiling of materials by EU countries.

– Facilitating the joint purchasing and stockpiling of materials by EU countries. Boosting recycling – Creating systems to keep more critical materials within the EU for recycling.

– Creating systems to keep more critical materials within the EU for recycling. Central coordination – Establishing a critical raw materials center to oversee diversification efforts.

The initial funding will support specific projects, such as a molybdenum mine in Greenland operated by a Canadian company and a lithium extraction project in Germany.

The Commission's ambitious targets project that by 2030, dependency on China for permanent magnets will fall to 80%, for rare earth extraction to 42%, and for processing to 60%.

For other key battery and defense materials, where current dependency ranges up to 89%, the goal is to bring it down to between zero and 64%.

Senior EU officials acknowledged that China has used its dominant position in raw materials for "geopolitical purposes," creating a clear need to accelerate the diversification process. The strategy also introduces a new guideline for corporate responsibility, gently encouraging, and potentially later mandating, companies to diversify their supply chains.

"This is a way for us to gently encourage them to diversify… if this were not the case… We reserve the right to use legislation," explained Commission Executive Vice-President Stephane Sejourne. The approach will remind procurement officials to communicate diversification plans to their boards.

This mineral security push dovetails with the EU's broader ambitions to bolster its defense industry and support Ukraine, as both efforts require resilient, home-grown, or diversified supply chains for critical components. By taking control of its resource destiny, the EU aims to safeguard its economic stability, ensure the success of its green transition and strengthen its geopolitical footing in an increasingly competitive world.

The Health Ranger Mike Adams warns that China's control over rare earth minerals gives it global dominance over military, industrial and technological output. Watch this video to know more.

Putin and Modi expand India-Russia economic ties in talks in New Delhi

MUMBAI, India — There was a hug and selfie in a limousine ride after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally picked up Russian President Vladimir Putin on arrival in the capital New Delhi on Thursday evening. Devotional lamps spelled out "Welcome Putin" during an evening prayer at the Ganges River that was shared online. There was an honor guard and a brass band.

India was warmly welcoming Putin for his first visit since his country invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago. The visit in part signaled India's defiance to the Trump administration, which has punished, and publicly humiliated, New Delhi for its purchases of Russian oil.

Sponsor Message

"The message first and foremost is that India has options," said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House. "It is an effort to reaffirm the India-Russia relationship at a time when India has been under growing pressure to sever that relationship, or at least downgrade it in some ways."

India has long prided itself on its independent foreign policy, but grew close to Russia decades ago, when it was the dominant part of the Soviet Union. The policy came in response to a sense of being cornered on its northern borders: Pakistan firmly allied itself with the U.S., and in the early 1970s, facilitated an opening in relations between Washington and Beijing. India and China share more than 2,000 miles of disputed border across the Himalayas.

The two-day meeting that began Thursday in New Delhi was a boon to Putin, whose travels have been largely curtailed since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against him in March 2023. "To visit the world's largest democracy and a large country like India, will bring him enormous global attention in that sense," said Swaran Singh, who writes on international relations.

After a bilateral meeting on Friday, where both sides announced a deal to allow more Indian nationals to work in Russia, Putin said in prepared statements through a translator that his country was "ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast growing Indian economy."

Russian oil in focus

India had ramped up its purchasing of Russian oil after the invasion of Ukraine, and is now one of the world's biggest buyers. It also sells Russian oil products onwards.

But Indian companies curbed their purchases of Russian oil in recent weeks, after the Trump administration punitively doubled its tariffs on India to 50% and American sanctions were imposed on Kremlin-linked Russian oil producers.

Most prominently, India's biggest importer of Russian crude oil, Reliance Industries stopped purchasing Russian crude oil for its export products, Reuters reported in late November. That was to remain in compliance with a new European Union ban on imports of refined products made from Russian crude from some third countries, including India.

It is unclear how Putin can continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India amid sanctions and tariffs. But the Finnish-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air reports there has been an increase in sanctions-avoiding behavior by vessels shipping Russian oil on the high seas, in part through flying flags that have been fraudulently obtained to conceal their operations. Previously India has described the pressure to cut its purchases of Russian oil as "unreasonable," noting that both the European Union and the United States also purchase Russian energy products.

Treading a fine line

India has been stepping up purchases of U.S. oil and natural gas — which some analysts have interpreted as a sop to the Trump administration — and, to narrow its trade deficit with the U.S., also sought to purchase more U.S. energy products.

"India is navigating a difficult path," said Bajpaee of Chatham House. "It's trying to maintain close relations with Moscow and at the same time deepen engagement with the West."

Perhaps to that end, in the Indian prime minister's prepared statements, he nodded to Russia's invasion, describing it as "the situation in Ukraine." He added, "We welcome all efforts being made for a peaceful and lasting resolution in this matter. India has always been, and will always be ready to contribute."

It wasn't clear, however, if Modi was referring to the Trump administration's current efforts to end the war. On Tuesday, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Putin and his team for five hours. But Putin told the news outlet India Today on Thursday that "we can't agree to" some of the administration's proposals, without giving further details. When pressed on the matter during the same interview, he said through a translator: "I doubt it would interest you to hear

[TITLE]How Mexico Revived Its Renewable Energy Sector:
[TEXT]
After several years of stagnation in Mexico’s renewable energy sector, the introduction of more favourable reforms alongside several new solar energy agreements suggests that the Latin American country is pursuing a more diversified energy mix. After several years of energy policy that focused on greater nationalisation, the door is once again open for private participation, which is expected to include the development of several green energy projects and attract investment from various firms worldwide.

Under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), who led the Morena party from 2018 to 2024, Mexico’s energy sector underwent a significant nationalisation, during which time it became harder for private companies to participate in the industry. AMLO decided to nationalise Mexico’s energy sector, citing over-greedy international energy companies, sectoral corruption, and the need for enhanced national energy security.

During his presidency, AMLO supported fossil fuel expansion, bailing out the state-owned oil and gas company PEMEX several times, as well as investing heavily in the construction of major new refineries. Meanwhile, investments in green energy stagnated as AMLO did not prioritise renewable energy development at the national level or allow for investment from private companies.

Since President Claudia Sheinbaum came into office in 2024, Mexico’s energy sector has begun to undergo a transformation, following the introduction of a new energy reform in March 2025. Sheinbaum followed in AMLO’s footsteps by maintaining the national majority ownership of the electricity sector, meaning the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) must provide at least 54 percent of the country’s electricity. The reform also disbanded the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), replacing them with a centralised National Energy Commission (CNE).

While Mexico’s energy sector will continue to be dominated by state-owned companies, Sheinbaum has reopened opportunities for foreign investment in the sector. In her national economic development strategy, Plan México, Sheinbaum introduced the aim of adding almost 23 GW of new power generation capacity by 2030, as well as establishing 100 transmission and distribution projects.

During her electoral campaign, Sheinbaum stated her commitment to renewable energy, emphasising the potential to develop Mexico’s abundant solar and wind resources. “We are going to propel renewable energy in Mexico,” Sheinbaum said during her inauguration. “The objective is that by 2030, 45 percent of the country’s energy will be powered by renewable sources.”

The government plans to invest over $22 billion by 2030 to expand CFE’s electricity generation and distribution. Meanwhile, Mexico aims to attract between $6 and $9 billion in private investment to establish between 6.4 GW and 9.5 GW of new clean-energy capacity by 2030. The new energy reform allows both CFE and Pemex to enter mixed contracts with private companies, so long as they hold a majority share of the project.

In October, Mexico’s Energy Ministry invited private companies to participate in the construction of 34 new power plants to accelerate the expansion of the country’s electricity capacity. The projects include 23 solar photovoltaic and 11 wind power plants across 20 states. Operations are scheduled to commence between 2027 and 2030. Once completed, the facilities are expected to add 5.97 GW of installed capacity.

“The call is part of specific mechanisms to develop strategic and priority projects aligned with binding planning, ensuring an orderly and coherent approach to meeting the National Electric System’s capacity needs,” the Ministry’s announcement stated.

In late October, the Spanish clean energy firm The Cox Group announced an investment of $4.2 billion for new solar and wind farms in Mexico’s border state of Nuevo León. The projects will be developed in the state capital of Monterrey, as well as other municipalities, and are expected to support the creation of 4,000 temporary jobs and 250 permanent positions. The Cox Group and the state government are developing a comprehensive strategy that includes water treatment and reuse, gas cogeneration, and energy efficiency.

In November, the German utility RWE announced plans to launch solar projects in Mexico. RWE’s subsidiary Oyamel Recursos Ambientales is developing a 120 MW PV plant in Veracruz, while its Biznaga subsidiary aims to build the 90 MW Cerro Pelón PV plant in Jalisco. Meanwhile, Canadian Solar’s Recurrent Energy hopes to get approval for a $63 million solar plant in Zacatecas. Spain’s Global Dominion Access and Canadian Solar also submitted environmental permit requests to develop solar operations, while Iberdrola announced plans to develop two solar projects totalling 535 MW in Mexico.

A recent report by the energy think tank Ember forecast that private investment and energy storage in Mexico could grow to as much as 36 GW of solar power and 30 GWh of battery storage in the coming years, owing to a greater openness to private participation in Mexico’s energy sector. As much as 46 percent of the country’s electricity generation could come from private projects, suggesting the beginning of a shift away from nationalisation.

[TITLE]COP30 in Belém: Joint Effort, Tensions and a Path to the End of Fossil Fuels:
[TEXT]
The holding of the 30th UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém made history for two complementary reasons: it was the first climate conference hosted in the Amazon, and it put forests, Indigenous peoples and civil society back at the center of climate negotiations. Bringing together 195 countries and culminating in the unanimous adoption of 29 decisions, the conference showed that, despite geopolitical contradictions and obstacles, there is still room for collective progress.

The key points of Belém were the “joint decision,” the shifting positions of the European Union, the objections of large oil-producing countries and the enormous efforts of Brazilian diplomatic coordination to deliver on implementation of the Paris Agreement. In parallel with the diplomatic conference, Belém welcomed a vigorous presence of civil society, a powerful expression of its commitment to social justice in the fight against climate change.

The decision to join forces: strategy, scope and limits

In the context of the climate negotiations, the Brazilian presidency of the COP created the Mutirão — a “joint decision” strategy to untangle sensitive issues and stitch together a single package of decisions that included finance, adaptation, just transition, trade, gender and technology. At the end of the conference, this package resulted in the approval of 29 documents that sought to advance on multiple fronts without leaving behind urgent demands from the Global South.

Among the financial measures approved, concrete allocations of $135 million to the Adaptation Fund and $300 million to adapt the health sector to climate impacts stand out. The presidency also proposed reformulating climate finance reporting, linking it to the New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance (NCQG), seeking greater transparency between “provided” and “mobilized” resources.

On the other hand, financial ambition fell short of what was necessary: the task-force proposal foresees tripling adaptation financing by 2035 compared with 2025, but without a clearly defined base value. This gap reflects the historical difficulty of the multilateral system in translating political commitment into measurable financial flows — a challenge that, according to climate finance experts, is reflected in the current adaptation finance gap, estimated at around $340 billion. This amount is forecast to reach $1.35 trillion by 2035.

No binding target was delivered to finance adaptation, and the multilateral ambition to mobilize trillions for clean infrastructure remains without clear accountability mechanisms. The recognition that historical goals have not been met gained space in the final text, but without new and effective structures that guarantee the flow of resources where they are most urgent.

Among other points in the task-force decision, advances were made on information integrity and the fight against climate disinformation — essential to confronting denialism, including disinformation promoted by parts of the fossil-fuel industry. There were also developments on carbon markets and discussions on high-integrity rules — a necessary subject for robust accounting of carbon credits, which remains controversial given cases of fraud and technical errors worldwide.

The EU’s position: defensive pragmatism

The European Union played a decisive role in the final design of the “joint decision”. European officials adopted a pragmatic stance: supporting the negotiated package as long as it did not include provisions they considered unfeasible or unsupported, especially those related to the energy transition. In negotiations, European representatives conditioned their greater willingness to finance adaptation on the inclusion — from their point of view — of balanced measures in the energy transition.

This stance produced two key effects: (1) the EU helped ensure approval of the package, avoiding a total impasse; (2) at the same time, its bargaining limited the financial ambition of the final text, contributing to less binding wording on goals and responsibilities. Observers interpreted this strategy as a balance between pro-climate rhetoric and cautious practice — especially relevant after the United States’s direct absence, which altered traditional leadership dynamics.

Objections from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, India and Russia: blocking the fossil roadmap

One of the most sensitive points in the Belém negotiations was the so‑called “roadmap” for moving away from an economy dependent on fossil fuels — an explicit priority of the Brazilian presidency. Although the initiative gained important political support, especially from the Global South and activist leaders, it did not make it into the final texts due to a lack of consensus. Fossil-fuel-producing countries (notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), as well as major emitters such as China and India, and to a lesser extent, Russia, and even Japan, raised firm objections.

These objections ranged from practical issues (timing, socioeconomic impacts and energy security) to geopolitical positions defending industrial and revenue interests. For many of these countries, formal commitments to abandon fossil fuels would entail high political and economic costs, requiring guarantees of finance, technology transfer and just treatment for workers and communities. This bloc managed to bar inclusion of the roadmap in the joint decision, relegating it to a parallel initiative — albeit one that faces growing political pressure.

Brazilian diplomatic leadership: sewing consensus and maintaining the agenda

Brazil, as COP30 president, worked intensively to transform the mutirão effort into a political reality. The presidency’s strategy combined multilateral diplomacy (bilateral and multilateral negotiations), global visibility — placing the Amazon at the center of discussions — and bridge-building among groups of countries. The presidency proposed the creation of an international just-transition mechanism, with a draft to be presented by June 2026 and contributions open until March 15, 2026, aiming to establish an instrument to organize finance, technical cooperation and capacity building.

This action produced results: 122 countries presented new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) during COP30, and a package of decisions elevated just transition as an institutional priority. However, the Brazilian effort coexists with internal contradictions — part of the government promoted a roadmap for renewables even as the state authorized oil exploration auctions at the mouth of the Amazon, renewed contracts for gas and coal thermal plants through 2040, and faced a Congress

Energy trader BGN is set to expand its fledgling natural gas business into a global portfolio with stakes in plants, vessels and pipelines.

The push comes as the market for liquefied natural gas is set to boom, with US exports ramping up and Qatar, another major producer, also adding output. While that’s likely to push prices lower, the wave of extra supplies is poised to create new trading opportunities.

The firm is in talks to buy LNG on contracts as long as 15 years, as well as equity in U.S. export plants, the company’s co-heads of LNG, Ruben Mosquera Arias and Maria Eugenia Suardiaz, said in an interview in Istanbul on Thursday.

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

In parallel with the diplomatic conference, Belém welcomed a vigorous presence of civil society, a powerful expression of its commitment to social justice in the fight against climate change.

The decision to join forces: strategy, scope and limits

In the context of the climate negotiations, the Brazilian presidency of the COP created the Mutirão — a “joint decision” strategy to untangle sensitive issues and stitch together a single package of decisions that included finance, adaptation, just transition, trade, gender and technology. At the end of the conference, this package resulted in the approval of 29 documents that sought to advance on multiple fronts without leaving behind urgent demands from the Global South.

Among the financial measures approved, concrete allocations of $135 million to the Adaptation Fund and $300 million to adapt the health sector to climate impacts stand out. The presidency also proposed reformulating climate finance reporting, linking it to the New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance (NCQG), seeking greater transparency between “provided” and “mobilized” resources.

On the other hand, financial ambition fell short of what was necessary: the task-force proposal foresees tripling adaptation financing by 2035 compared with 2025, but without a clearly defined base value. This gap reflects the historical difficulty of the multilateral system in translating political commitment into measurable financial flows — a challenge that, according to climate finance experts, is reflected in the current adaptation finance gap, estimated at around $340 billion. This amount is forecast to reach $1.35 trillion by 2035.

No binding target was delivered to finance adaptation, and the multilateral ambition to mobilize trillions for clean infrastructure remains without clear accountability mechanisms. The recognition that historical goals have not been met gained space in the final text, but without new and effective structures that guarantee the flow of resources where they are most urgent.

Among other points in the task-force decision, advances were made on information integrity and the fight against climate disinformation — essential to confronting denialism, including disinformation promoted by parts of the fossil-fuel industry. There were also developments on carbon markets and discussions on high-integrity rules — a necessary subject for robust accounting of carbon credits, which remains controversial given cases of fraud and technical errors worldwide.

The EU’s position: defensive pragmatism

The European Union played a decisive role in the final design of the “joint decision”. European officials adopted a pragmatic stance: supporting the negotiated package as long as it did not include provisions they considered unfeasible or unsupported, especially those related to the energy transition. In negotiations, European representatives conditioned their greater willingness to finance adaptation on the inclusion — from their point of view — of balanced measures in the energy transition.

This stance produced two key effects: (1) the EU helped ensure approval of the package, avoiding a total impasse; (2) at the same time, its bargaining limited the financial ambition of the final text, contributing to less binding wording on goals and responsibilities. Observers interpreted this strategy as a balance between pro-climate rhetoric and cautious practice — especially relevant after the United States’s direct absence, which altered traditional leadership dynamics.

Objections from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, India and Russia: blocking the fossil roadmap

One of the most sensitive points in the Belém negotiations was the so‑called “roadmap” for moving away from an economy dependent on fossil fuels — an explicit priority of the Brazilian presidency. Although the initiative gained important political support, especially from the Global South and activist leaders, it did not make it into the final texts due to a lack of consensus. Fossil-fuel-producing countries (notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), as well as major emitters such as China and India, and to a lesser extent, Russia, and even Japan, raised firm objections.

These objections ranged from practical issues (timing, socioeconomic impacts and energy security) to geopolitical positions defending industrial and revenue interests. For many of these countries, formal commitments to abandon fossil fuels would entail high political and economic costs, requiring guarantees of finance, technology transfer and just treatment for workers and communities. This bloc managed to bar inclusion of the roadmap in the joint decision, relegating it to a parallel initiative — albeit one that faces growing political pressure.

Brazilian diplomatic leadership: sewing consensus and maintaining the agenda

Brazil, as COP30 president, worked intensively to transform the mutirão effort into a political reality. The presidency’s strategy combined multilateral diplomacy (bilateral and multilateral negotiations), global visibility — placing the Amazon at the center of discussions — and bridge-building among groups of countries. The presidency proposed the creation of an international just-transition mechanism, with a draft to be presented by June 2026 and contributions open until March 15, 2026, aiming to establish an instrument to organize finance, technical cooperation and capacity building.

This action produced results: 122 countries presented new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) during COP30, and a package of decisions elevated just transition as an institutional priority. However, the Brazilian effort coexists with internal contradictions — part of the government promoted a roadmap for renewables even as the state authorized oil exploration auctions at the mouth of the Amazon, renewed contracts for gas and coal thermal plants through 2040, and faced a Congress

EU launches $3.5 billion initiative to break China’s grip on critical minerals

The EU is launching a €3 billion initiative called RESourceEU to break its heavy reliance on China for critical raw materials. Currently, China supplies nearly all of Europe's rare earth elements and magnets, which are essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy and defense systems.

This move is part of a broader, more assertive EU economic security strategy. It aims to protect against the "weaponization" of trade by utilizing tools such as screening foreign investments and strengthening key industries to prevent supply chain disruptions.

The strategy involves more than just funding. It plans to fast-track mining permits, enable joint purchasing of materials by EU countries, boost recycling to keep materials in Europe and create a central office to oversee these efforts.

The EU has set clear goals to reduce its dependency on China by 2030. For example, it aims to cut reliance on Chinese rare earth extraction from 95% to 42%, and on processing from 100% to 60%.

The EU will start by gently encouraging companies to diversify their supply chains away from China, with the implied threat of future legislation if they do not comply. This effort is closely linked to the bloc's goals of strengthening its defense industry and supporting Ukraine.

In a decisive move to secure its industrial future, the European Union (EU) has unveiled a major funding initiative and a new strategic doctrine aimed at drastically reducing its dependency on China for the vital earth metals that power everything from electric vehicles to wind turbines and defense systems.

The bloc's executive arm, the European Commission, announced that it will release approximately €3 billion ($3.5 billion) next year to finance projects that diversify Europe’s supply of critical raw materials. This funding is the cornerstone of a new initiative named RESourceEU, modeled on the successful REPowerEU plan that helped wean Europe off Russian energy.

The urgency of the plan is underscored by stark statistics. As explained by BrightU.AI's Enoch AI engine, the EU currently relies on China for 90% of its permanent magnets, 95% of its extracted rare earth elements and a full 100% of its rare earth processing and recycling. These materials are indispensable for the green and digital transitions, making this dependency a significant economic security risk.

"Our goal is to prevent short-term disruptions, while steadily reducing risky dependencies and avoiding new ones," stated European Commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic, highlighting concerns over the weaponization of trade and state-backed overcapacities.

The newly outlined economic security strategy marks a "more proactive" stance from Brussels. It involves maximizing existing trade tools and creating new ones across six priority areas, including screening foreign investments, strengthening key industries and protecting critical infrastructure.

The RESourceEU initiative goes beyond just funding

The RESourceEU initiative's multi-pronged approach includes:

Fast-tracking projects – Cutting bureaucratic red tape to accelerate permits for mining and processing ventures.

– Cutting bureaucratic red tape to accelerate permits for mining and processing ventures. Joint action – Facilitating the joint purchasing and stockpiling of materials by EU countries.

– Facilitating the joint purchasing and stockpiling of materials by EU countries. Boosting recycling – Creating systems to keep more critical materials within the EU for recycling.

– Creating systems to keep more critical materials within the EU for recycling. Central coordination – Establishing a critical raw materials center to oversee diversification efforts.

The initial funding will support specific projects, such as a molybdenum mine in Greenland operated by a Canadian company and a lithium extraction project in Germany.

The Commission's ambitious targets project that by 2030, dependency on China for permanent magnets will fall to 80%, for rare earth extraction to 42%, and for processing to 60%.

For other key battery and defense materials, where current dependency ranges up to 89%, the goal is to bring it down to between zero and 64%.

Senior EU officials acknowledged that China has used its dominant position in raw materials for "geopolitical purposes," creating a clear need to accelerate the diversification process. The strategy also introduces a new guideline for corporate responsibility, gently encouraging, and potentially later mandating, companies to diversify their supply chains.

"This is a way for us to gently encourage them to diversify… if this were not the case… We reserve the right to use legislation," explained Commission Executive Vice-President Stephane Sejourne. The approach will remind procurement officials to communicate diversification plans to their boards.

This mineral security push dovetails with the EU's broader ambitions to bolster its defense industry and support Ukraine, as both efforts require resilient, home-grown, or diversified supply chains for critical components. By taking control of its resource destiny, the EU aims to safeguard its economic stability, ensure the success of its green transition and strengthen its geopolitical footing in an increasingly competitive world.

The Health Ranger Mike Adams warns that China's control over rare earth minerals gives it global dominance over military, industrial and technological output. Watch this video to know more.

[TITLE]EU, FG Partner to Close Nigeria's Power Sector Skills Gap:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government has warned that Nigeria’s power sector reforms risk stalling unless urgent steps are taken to close the widening skills gap across the electricity value chain, even as the European Union announced fresh support for renewable energy deployment and workforce development in the country.

The union also stated that it has invested more than €200m in grants since 2008 to support Nigeria’s power sector, including policy reforms, capacity building, and market development.

It added that under its current 2021–2027 programme, the target is to support Nigeria in adding 4,00 megawatts of renewable energy capacity, a move expected to supply cleaner electricity to

[TITLE]A Ray of Hope Amid the Climate Information War:
[TEXT]
Lee Zeldin, the Trump loyalist appointed to head the Environmental Protection Agency, seems to be following Musk’s lead. On Tuesday, he announced the termination of $20 billion in grants that have already been promised to institutions via the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, which Congress established in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. He cited “substantial concerns regarding program integrity, objections to the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the agency’s priorities,” but provided no evidence to support such widespread fraud claims. The best he came up with was that “a group linked to Stacey Abrams received two billion dollars after reporting a mere 100 dollars in total revenue the year before” (a debunking of which you can read here) and that “the founding director of the EPA’s program dished out $5 billion to his former employer.”

Pending clarity on the details, one could argue this last allegation is a conflict of interest—a weak one, given that the individual in question, Jahi Wise, doesn’t seem to have been rehired by that former employer—but not fraud, and not a conflict that can hold a candle to Musk, whose business has been built on an estimated $38 billion in government spending, being given the keys to the federal coffers and cutting subsidies to his flailing car company’s ascendant competitors.
