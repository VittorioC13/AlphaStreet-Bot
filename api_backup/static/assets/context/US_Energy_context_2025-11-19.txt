[TITLE]Welspun taps EY for next big clean-energy stake sale of $100 million:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: Close to a decade after selling its renewables portfolio to Tata Power, billionaire B.K.Goenka’s Welspun World has charted out its next big deal. This time, it has hired EY to sell a majority stake in Welspun New Energy, its clean-energy platform, for an equity value of around $100 million, according to two people aware of the development.

“The sale process has been launched," one of the two people cited above said, requesting anonymity. “The next step involves signing of non-disclosure agreements, post which the financial model and the information memorandum will be shared. After meeting the management for discussions, prospective investors will give their indicative proposals."

Welspun New Energy has 1.2GW of contracted capacity. Of this, 866 mega watt (MW) is contracted with state-run NTPC Ltd, Solar Energy Corporation of India (Seci) and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. The company also has 3.1GW of projects under development that have transmission connectivity.

Welspun World is an infrastructure development company with a focus on transportation, water and wastewater, oil and gas exploration, and tunnelling segments. In 2016, it had sold its entire 1.1 gigawatt (GW) renewable energy portfolio of Welspun Energy Ltd to Tata Power for $1.4 billion.

An EY spokesperson declined to comment. Queries emailed to a Welspun World spokesperson on late Sunday night remained unanswered till press time.

The proposed sale of Welspun New Energy comes in the backdrop of a major cleanup of India’s green energy contracts.

As reported by Mint earlier, the Union power ministry has directed state-run procurers—Seci, NTPC, NHPC, and SJVN—to cancel contracts by the end of this month where it is not feasible to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) and power supply agreements (PSAs).

State-run energy companies have signed their first-ever annual cooking gas supply deal with the US, aiming to narrow India’s trade surplus with Washington amid ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration. The diversification is also aimed at reducing New Delhi’s overdependence on Gulf suppliers, a key vulnerability during regional flare-ups.“Indian PSU oil companies have successfully concluded a one-year deal for imports of around 2.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) LPG, close to 10% of our annual imports — for the contract year 2026, to be sourced from the US Gulf Coast — the first structured contract of US LPG for the Indian market,” oil minister Hardeep Puri said on Monday.India imports two-thirds of the LPG it consumes, relying on Gulf suppliers, mainly Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, for more than 90% of those imports.LPG is a mix of propane and butane and used in India predominantly for cooking.“The risk of relying on a single region has long been clear, but the flare-up in June between Iran, Israel and the US finally pushed companies to seek alternatives,” said an industry executive.IndianOil, Hindustan Petroleum , and Bharat Petroleum will buy LPG priced off Mont Belvieu, the key US spot benchmark. Gulf suppliers use Saudi Aramco’s contract price (CP). Lower Gulf freight has historically kept India tied to the region.The new deal gives US suppliers the option to ship one in every four cargoes from any other country, offering flexibility if American cargoes turn uneconomic, an industry executive said.The arbitrage hinges on the spread between Mont Belvieu and Saudi CP. When the gap widens enough to cover high freight — including Panama Canal fees — US LPG becomes viable for Asia.US propane output has more than doubled in a decade, with exports rising for 17 straight years. As the US-China trade war crimps Chinese intake, Washington is seeking alternative buyers.India, facing US pressure to rebalance trade, committed in February to sharply boost energy purchases from the US by $10 billion to $25 billion.Saudi, anticipating increased US volumes to India and other Asian markets, has already cut CP prices to its lowest level in November since August 2023.LPG consumption in India has more than doubled in a decade to reach 3.3 million households, making any supply disruption politically sensitive. Unlike crude — where India holds larger inventories and has diversified sources — LPG stockpiles are thin. Tight LPG reserves and high import dependence make the fuel far more exposed than petrol, diesel or aviation turbine fuel (ATF), which India exports in large volumes and can redirect domestically if needed.India imported 20.7 million tonnes of LPG and consumed 31.3 million tonnes in 2024-25.

[TITLE]Oil Stabilizes After Selloff Amid OPEC Reassessment and U.S. Funding Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after a sharp 4% slide the day before, with Brent trading near $63.08 and WTI around $58.80 at 11:01 a.m. ET, as traders reassessed the latest OPEC shift toward a more balanced 2026 market outlook. The passage of the U.S. funding deal that ended the government shutdown removed one macro problem, but crude remained focused on supply signals rather than broader risk sentiment.

The modest rebound contrasted with the equity rally highlighted by Bloomberg, where U.S. indices advanced on softer inflation readings, renewed risk appetite and relief following the shutdown resolution. The move in equities had limited pull on crude, which stayed driven by evolving supply projections and near-term balance concerns.

The recovery follows Tuesday’s selloff linked to OPEC’s updated projections, which show the cartel moving away from its earlier deficit view and toward a neutral supply-demand balance next year. Traders reacted to signals that rising non-OPEC output and incremental OPEC+ barrels could offset moderate consumption growth. Those factors, combined with a softer demand trajectory outlined in the IEA’s latest assessment, left the market focused on potential surplus risk.

Diesel margins firmed during the session, while crude futures recovered more slowly. Murban traded near 65.43 on steady Asian buying and stable demand for middle distillates. Natural gas edged toward 4.62, supported by early-season heating needs and lower storage levels.

The Bloomberg update showed equities rising as Treasury yields fell, but that shift offered little lift to crude. Traders said oil remains tied to OPEC+ supply decisions and demand expectations through early 2026, not the broader market mood.

A softer dollar and lower Treasury yields added some support to commodities, though they did not shift the outlook for crude supplies. Asia continued to take regular cargoes, and early-winter demand for diesel and jet fuel stayed firm. Traders said many positions were still small following Tuesday’s selloff as the market waits for guidance on upcoming OPEC+ output levels and demand expectations for early 2026.

[TITLE]ProLift Rigging: Revamping oil & gas infrastructure in the USA:
[TEXT]
Photo courtesy of Getty Images on Unsplash.

Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.

The U.S. oil and gas infrastructure plays a vital role in maintaining energy security, economic stability, and industrial competitiveness. However, much of this network is aging, leading to safety risks and inefficiencies. In response, both public and private sectors are mobilizing to modernize systems through advanced technologies, strategic investments, and updated regulatory frameworks.

With key regions like the Permian Basin, Gulf Coast, and Appalachia at the center of these efforts, The The ProLift Rigging Company says that the industry is navigating a complex landscape of environmental concerns, policy shifts, and growing energy demands. These combined efforts are shaping the future of the nation’s energy infrastructure and its role in a transitioning global energy market.

Overview of U.S. oil and gas infrastructure

The oil and gas infrastructure in the United States includes an expansive network of pipelines, refineries, and storage facilities that support the production, transportation, and processing of petroleum and natural gas. Much of this network was built decades ago, with some systems dating back to the mid-20th century. In regions where the population has grown around legacy infrastructure, safety and environmental concerns have also become more prominent.

As this infrastructure continues to age, operators face recurring challenges such as corrosion, equipment failures, and the need for more frequent maintenance. In areas like the Midwest and Gulf Coast, older pipeline segments have become more vulnerable to leaks and service disruptions, pointing to a growing need for strategic updates. Despite the scale of the network, modernization has lagged in some regions due to limited funding or regulatory hurdles.

Drivers for modernization

Aging pipelines and processing equipment have contributed to a rise in safety incidents, prompting public concern and regulatory scrutiny. In some cases, leaks and ruptures have led to environmental damage and costly cleanups, intensifying the urgency for upgrades. Public trust in industry practices has also been tested, leading to increased pressure on operators to take preventive action.

Beyond safety, modernizing infrastructure offers measurable efficiency gains. Updated systems can reduce energy consumption during transport and refining, helping operators lower operational costs and meet stricter emissions standards. In competitive markets, even small efficiency improvements can enhance profitability and reduce exposure to penalties.

Public expectations have also changed. Communities near oil and gas facilities are demanding better environmental safeguards and transparency from industry players. This growing pressure is driving government bodies and companies to prioritize modernization as part of broader environmental and economic strategies.

Advances in technology and system upgrades

Technology is transforming how oil and gas infrastructure is monitored and maintained. Smart sensors, remote monitoring tools, and automated control systems now allow operators to detect issues like pressure changes or corrosion before they become major problems. These tools can also reduce the need for manual inspections, improving worker safety and response time.

New materials, including advanced coatings and corrosion-resistant alloys, are extending the lifespan of pipelines and storage tanks. These innovations help reduce downtime and repair costs while enhancing the overall safety of the system.

Real-time data analytics are also playing a critical role. By analyzing large volumes of operational data, companies can predict maintenance needs, optimize performance, and avoid potential failures. These digital tools are becoming essential in a sector that must balance reliability with evolving environmental and regulatory demands.

Policy and regulatory environment

Federal and state policies are shaping the pace and direction of oil and gas infrastructure upgrades. Legislation such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has unlocked billions in funding, incentivizing companies to modernize aging assets while meeting updated environmental guidelines. These incentives are particularly impactful for smaller firms that may lack the capital to invest in large-scale upgrades independently.

Permitting remains a key hurdle, often slowing down essential projects due to lengthy review processes and overlapping jurisdictional requirements. These delays can deter investment and complicate planning, especially when projects span multiple states or sensitive environmental zones. The balancing act between thorough assessment and timely project approval remains a central policy debate.

Regulatory agencies are also tightening oversight on emissions and safety compliance, requiring operators to adopt more sophisticated monitoring and reporting systems. This shift is pushing the industry toward greater accountability, but it also demands significant resource allocation to meet new benchmarks.

Industry actions and investment strategies

Energy companies are actively investing in infrastructure upgrades to remain competitive and compliant. In the Permian Basin, firms have launched modernization projects that include replacing outdated pipelines and integrating digital monitoring systems to improve efficiency and reduce downtime. Some of these upgrades also aim to support carbon capture and storage initiatives, aligning with broader decarbonization goals.

Public-private partnerships are becoming more common, especially where large-scale improvements demand technical expertise and financial backing. These collaborations allow infrastructure development to proceed more quickly while aligning with public interests such as job creation and environmental stewardship. Such partnerships also help navigate community engagement and regulatory compliance more smoothly.

Some companies are also diversifying their energy portfolios, incorporating renewable technologies into existing operations. This hybrid approach is part of a broader strategy to future-proof assets and respond to shifting policy and market pressures.

Regional focus and outlook

Different regions face their own unique infrastructure challenges. Along the Gulf Coast, extreme weather events have exposed vulnerabilities in coastal refineries and transport networks, leading to renewed focus on climate resilience and disaster preparedness. In response, some operators are elevating facilities and reinforcing key assets to withstand flooding and hurricanes.

In Appalachia, infrastructure expansion has sparked debates between economic development and environmental protection. While the region holds vast natural gas reserves, local opposition to new projects has slowed progress, requiring careful negotiation between stakeholders. Legal challenges and public hearings often extend timelines, affecting the economic feasibility of new ventures.

[TITLE]FireFly Metals announces Mineral Resource increased by 51% at Green Bay Copper Gold Project, Canada:
[TEXT]
Exceptional result includes a spectacular high-grade Mineral Resource of 8.8Mt @ 3.9% CuEq (346kt CuEq) in M&I and 10.9Mt @ 3.8% CuEq (414kt CuEq) in Inferred categories; This recently established high-grade core zone stands to deliver huge benefits to the Project’s development potential, particularly in the early years

KEY POINTS

Substantial Mineral Resource Increase and Upgrade:

Green Bay Mineral Resource increases to 50.4Mt @ 2.0% copper equivalent (CuEq) 1 in the Measured and Indicated (M&I) categories and 29.3Mt @ 2.5% CuEq in the Inferred Mineral Resource category (Inferred)

The total contained metal and total tonnes have increased significantly Contained copper increases to 863kt M&I (+113%) plus 566kt Inferred Contained gold increases to 546koz M&I (+174%) plus 563koz Inferred (+62%)

A newly established high-grade core zone of the Mineral Resource includes 8.8Mt @ 3.9% CuEq in the M&I and 10.9Mt @ 3.8% CuEq in the Inferred Resource categories

Importantly, the highly valuable M&I categories of Mineral Resource at the Ming Deposit have grown by 121% (from 21.5Mt to 47.5Mt) and now make up 67% of the Ming Deposit Mineral Resource. This is significant as the M&I Resources will underpin economic studies

The Outlook – Mineral Resource growth and upgrades, eight rigs, economic studies, offtake discussions, regional discoveries:

The mineralisation remains completely open, including in the high-grade core zone, where the furthest step-out hole ever drilled on the edge of this Mineral Resource graded 49m @ 6.1% CuEq (including 14.3m @ 13.7% CuEq) (see ASX announcement dated 16 October 2025)

(see ASX announcement dated 16 October 2025) Scope for further growth is also shown by the large high-tenor Down Hole Electro-Magnetic (DHEM) conductor extending well beyond the boundary of the Mineral Resource

Drilling is underway to convert more Inferred Mineral Resources (29.3Mt @ 2.5% CuEq) to M&I for the economic studies; A large portion of the high-grade core comprises Inferred Mineral Resources, including drill hole MUG25-202 which returned 49.0m @ 6.1% CuEq, highlighting the strong scope for M&I growth

Given the potentially significant impact on the economic studies of the large amount of recently discovered high-grade mineralisation, particularly in the early years, FireFly intends to release the study results in the first half of 2026

Six rigs will continue drilling underground into 2026 while surface drill rigs will test the abundant targets generated by recent geophysics and field activities

Discussions with potential offtake customers, export credit agencies and other commercial entities regarding funding options are underway; Initial talks reveal a strong appetite for the Company’s Green Bay concentrate, with several confidentiality agreements already signed

FireFly had A$129.7M in cash, receivables and liquid investments at 30 September 2025

FireFly Managing Director Steve Parsons said: “This outstanding result cements Green Bay’s status as one of the most compelling copper development projects in the world.

“In just 12 months, we have grown the total Mineral Resource significantly. At the same time, we have established a high-grade core which stands to deliver huge benefits to the Project’s development potential, particularly in the initial years of production.

“We will maintain our relentless push to create shareholder value, with eight rigs on the job, to upgrade more of Inferred Mineral Resources to Measured and Indicated and to make new regional discoveries.

“And the appetite for our product is clearly very strong, with several parties signing confidentiality agreements and talks on offtake and funding progressing well.”

PERTH, Australia, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FireFly Metals Ltd (ASX, TSX: FFM) (Company or FireFly) is pleased to announce a substantial Mineral Resource increase comprising strong growth in tonnes, grade and contained metal at its Green Bay Copper-Gold Project in Newfoundland, Canada.

The Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) as updated in this announcement (November 2025 MRE) now stands at 50.4Mt @ 2.0% for 1Mt CuEq in the higher confidence Measured and Indicated (M&I) classifications plus an additional 29.3Mt @ 2.5% for 722kt CuEq in the Inferred category (Table 1). This represents a 35% increase in tonnes and a 51% increase in CuEq metal from the Mineral Resource Estimate announced by the Company on 29 October 2024 (October 2024 MRE).

Importantly, the MRE contains a zone of higher-grade material comprised of volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralisation plus the recently discovered ‘core zone’ which totals 8.8Mt @ 3.9% CuEq in M&I and a further 10.9Mt @ 3.8% CuEq in the Inferred category.

Copper remains the dominant metal in the MRE (863kt M&I plus 566kt Inferred Resources) with gold forming an important by-product (546koz M&I plus 563koz Inferred Resources). Silver is also present in significant quantities in the latest MRE (5.0Moz M&I plus 4.8Moz Inferred Resources).

The total discovery cost per estimated tonne of CuEq metal added in this MRE is exceptionally low at C$25.122 (US$17.83) per tonne.

The Ming Deposit has been sampled exclusively by diamond drilling. A total of 1,334 diamond holes for a total drilled meterage of 319,534m was used to estimate the November 2025 MRE.

The Mineral Resource consists of two components, namely the Ming Deposit (47.5Mt @ 2.0% CuEq M&I plus 23.1Mt @ 2.6% CuEq Inferred) and the Little Deer deposit (2.9Mt @ 2.3% CuEq M&I plus 6.2Mt @ 1.8% CuEq Inferred). All growth has come from the Ming Deposit with the Little Deer MRE remaining unchanged since the October 2024 MRE.

TONNES COPPER GOLD SILVER CuEq (Mt) Grade Metal Grade Metal Grade Metal Grade (%) (‘000 t) (g/t) (‘000 oz) (g/t) (‘000 oz) (%) Measured 6.3 1.5 94 0.3 50 1.9 388 1.7 Indicated 44.1 1.7 769 0.4 496 3.3 4,638 2.1 TOTAL M&I 50.4 1.7 863 0.3 546 3.1 5,026 2.0 Inferred 29.3 1.9 566 0.6 563 5.1 4,810 2.5

Table 1: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project as at 10 November 2025. The Mineral Resource is reported at a 1% copper cut-off. Gold-rich 1806 and 1807 VMS domains have been reported at a 1% CuEq cut-off. The same cut-off grade and metal equivalent parameters have been applied to the November 2025 MRE as the superseded October 2024 MRE to allow like-for-like comparisons. Refer to following sections of this announcement and Appendix B ‘JORC Table 1’ for further details on the MRE.

Both the Ming Deposit and Little Deer estimates have been prepared in accordance with the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code 2012) and Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). The MRE was completed by external independent consulting groups.

The November 2025 MRE saw significant increases across key categories (Figures 1 and 2). The increase in the Mineral Resource has been driven primarily by the successful growth strategy implemented by FireFly since it acquired Green Bay in October 2023. Over 2,300m of underground development has been mined at Green Bay’s Ming Deposit to position the drill rigs to effectively test down-plunge extensions of the high-grade VMS mineralisation and broad footwall copper stringer zone (FWZ).

Up to six underground rigs have been operating since the October 2024 MRE was completed and an additional 78,165m of drilling has been used to prepare this latest MRE (Figure 3).

The Company’s focus on upgrading areas of lesser drill spacing into higher confidence Mineral Resources is reflected by the 107% increase in the tonnes of M&I material. The M&I portion of the MRE increased from 24.4Mt in the October 2024 MRE to 50.4Mt in this MRE. Importantly, the M&I grade also increased despite the substantial increase in tonnes and now sits at 2.02% CuEq (+7%). M&I Mineral Resources now constitute 63% of the total MRE, which is significant because only the higher confidence M&I Mineral Resources can be used in future feasibility studies.

Overall, Inferred Mineral Resources decreased by 15%. This was primarily due to the successful conversion of 26Mt of Inferred material into the M&I category by infill drilling. The conversion was partially offset by the discovery of extensive down-plunge extensions of the Ming mineralisation up to 700m beyond the extent of the October 2024 MRE. The furthest step out hole into the mineralisation returned 49.0m @ 6.1% CuEq and remains open (see ASX announcement dated 16 October 2025). This intersection forms the limit of the November 2025 MRE.

The grade of copper and precious metals has significantly increased in the Inferred MRE due primarily to increasing grade at depth from the recent drilling. Drilling from the higher-grade core zone (see ASX announcement dated 27 October 2025) where the VMS and FWZ converge has been incorporated into this estimate in the Inferred category. Significant intersections from this zone include 86.3m @ 3.7% CuEq, 43.6m @ 7.6% CuEq and 44.5m @ 3.7% CuEq (see ASX announcement dated 27 October 2025). The Inferred MRE grade stands at 2.5% CuEq up from 2.0% CuEq in the October 2024 MRE. The grade of gold has almost doubled and now stands at 0.6g/t due to the addition of the higher-grade VMS material.

Furthermore, the addition of more VMS material in the latest MRE has seen contained gold in the MRE increase by 103% to now exceed 1.1Moz (546koz in M&I plus 563koz in Inferred). Silver has also increased significantly by 84% to total 9.8Moz (5.0Moz in M&I plus 4.8Moz in Inferred).

Figure 1: Year-on-Year increase in Mineral Resource contained copper equivalent metal since acquisition of the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project in 2023. Please refer to compliance statements for metal equivalent details.

Figure 2: Year on Year changes between the October 2024 MRE and November 2025 MRE for Tonnes, Grade and Contained Metal. This latest estimate has seen significant year-on-year increases in tonnes, grades and metal content.

With latest gold metallurgical testwork indicating recoveries of 85% (see ASX announcement dated 5 August 2025), gold will provide substantial by-product revenue in any potential future mining operation.

This November 2025 MRE is reported using a 1% copper cut-off grade, the same as the previous October 2024 MRE. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the potential scale of the Project increases significantly as the cut-off grade is lowered (Table 2). At a 0.6% copper cut-off, the estimate increases to 79.1Mt @ 1.7% for 1.2Mt CuEq in M&I plus 38.7Mt @ 2.1% for 804kt CuEq in Inferred. Both bulk and selective mining options will be contemplated as part of future economic evaluations.

Figure 3: Long section of the Ming Deposit MRE extent and new drilling completed since the previous October 2024 MRE. The MRE remains open and geophysical DHEM conductors indicate the mineralisation likely continues down plunge. Red wireframe is the FWZ mineralisation envelope and gold wireframes are the upper high-grade copper-gold VMS zones. Red on drillholes are assays >0.5% copper.

Forward Work Plans

Near-term drilling activities at the Green Bay Copper-Gold Project will continue to focus on three key areas: Upgrading the Mineral Resource (with infill drilling results), Mineral Resource Growth, and New Discoveries from both underground and surface. Six underground rigs will continue to advance the underground Mineral Resource growth for the foreseeable future and into 2026.

Green Bay - Ming Deposit Mineral Resource

The MRE update in this announcement is the result of the low-cost Mineral Resource growth strategy underpinned by drilling from the 805L exploration drive at the Ming Mine. Further mining of additional drill platforms is underway with the aim of delivering additional Mineral Resources in 2026.

Drilling from underground will prioritise conversion of the higher grade 29Mt of Inferred Mineral Resources into the higher confidence M&I category in preparation for the Feasibility Study expected to be completed in the second half of 2026 (Figure 5). In a Feasibility Study, only the higher confidence Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources can be used in developing the mine economics and therefore maximising M&I is critical to demonstrate the true scale and economic potential of the deposit.

Green Bay (Ming Mine) Upscaled Project Development

Work on the development of the upscaled resumption of mining at the Ming Mine is well underway. The MRE in this announcement will underpin the first Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study planned for completion in the first half of 2026.

Detailed mine design, scheduling and economic analysis based on the updated MRE in this announcement by both external consultants and the FireFly engineering team will now commence.

Ausenco continue to complete detailed engineering design work on the potential future processing facility. Further metallurgical testwork is underway to assess options to further optimise recovery of by-product precious metals from the Ming Deposit. This work has the potential to add significantly to the economics of the future mine, with the latest MRE containing 1.1Moz of gold and 9.8Moz of silver.

Design work has commenced in conjunction with local company Shoreline Aggregates Inc. to jointly develop an additional berth suitable for the export of copper concentrate from the nearby Pine Cove port (only 5km away). This work will continue into the new year, and the costings will be included in the PEA.

Company representatives and Directors have met with numerous offtake groups, sovereign credit export agencies and other commercial entities to discuss potential future funding pathways as the Project rapidly progresses towards feasibility. The appetite for the concentrate from the Ming Mine appears strong with numerous confidentiality agreements being signed with these counterparties. The financing strategy will be ongoing as the various scenarios for an upscaled restart to operations are being evaluated. With the significant increase in this latest MRE, the Company wishes to avoid unnecessarily limiting the size of any future potential upscaled mining operation until it has completed further economic assessment.

Following the recent conditional release from further Environmental Assessment by the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador for a start-up mining and processing operation (see ASX announcement dated 5 August 2025), the Company continues to apply for permits to commence early works and construction. The Company intends to commence selective low-cost seasonal early works in the coming months to prepare the Project for future development and construction.

Green Bay (Ming Mine) Regional Discovery

Regional exploration is underway with two surface drill rigs testing high-priority targets across the Company’s 346km2 surface exploration claims.

One of the drill rigs will continue to test high-priority targets close to the Ming Mine. The second drill rig will systematically test early-stage greenfields targets generated by airborne VTEM and magnetic surveys completed in 2024 and 2025.

FireFly has continued to invest in regional-scale geophysics as a key exploration tool. The Company is completing a detailed VTEM survey over the 115km2 Tilt Cove Project. A detailed helicopter magnetic survey is also being completed over the central Green Bay leases.

Timelines are indicative and may be subject to change.

Funding and Corporate Activities

The Company remains well funded to complete its accelerated exploration growth strategy and economic studies as the Project further advances toward rapid low-cost development. Cash, receivables and liquid investments total A$129.7M at 30 September 2025 (see ASX announcement dated 30 October 2025).

[TITLE]RE sector financing doubles as outstanding loans surge 2x in Sep:
[TEXT]
Indian banks are bullish on India’s renewable energy (RE) sector with loans outstanding to the sector as of September, more than doubling year-on-year (y-o-y).

Data from RBI shows that the outstanding credit to the renewable energy sector stood at ₹14,842 crore as of September 2025 as against ₹6,778 crore in the same period last year.

The growth significantly outpaces the rate of growth in other priority sectors like agriculture, MSMEs and Housing and is also up compared to the 39 per cent y-o-y growth from the September 2023 to September 2024 period

Speaking to businessline, industry experts said the increase in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution with GST reductions and favourable policy landscape pushing projects that were previously on hold to the implementation stage.

Healthy growth

Sachin Sachdeva, Vice President, Sector Head - Financial Sector Ratings , ICRA Ltd, said the overall growth of renewable energy sector remains healthy with significant capacity additions taking place y-o-y. “Consequently, a large part of the funding goes towards the under-construction projects as the already developed project would primarily have refinancing requirements,” he added.

Sachdeva noted that large infrastructure non-banking finance companies (NBFC-IFCs), who have a big play in the RE space, have also seen their assets under management (AUM) grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 30 per cent over the last two years.

Ramneek Sehgal, Chairman & Managing Director of infrastructure firm Ceigall India Ltd, noted that the surge in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution rather than just pipeline build-up, especially in the solar energy sector.

“With the sharp reduction in solar module prices and the ramp-up of domestic manufacturing capacity, many projects that were previously on hold have now moved into the implementation stage,” he said. Sehgal added that the solar sector has opened up after a period of supply-side constraints and policy adjustments with 42 Giga Watt of solar capacity additions expected in FY26.

Overall installed RE capacity in India as of October 2025 stood at around 2 lakh Mega Watt (MW) (excluding Large Hydro Power) with 27,927 MW added in the April-Oct 2025 period.

Vivek Jain, Director, India Ratings and Research said, “When we look at the loans outstanding it is a combination of both under-construction and commissioned projects and hence we see a significant jump in loans outstanding,” he added. Jain mentions that this trend will persist if under-construction projects continue at the same pace but if their pace declines, the loan growth would appear slower than capacity growth.

Costs moderating

Experts added that the rise in financing is more reflective of expanding execution activity rather than cost inflation.

“Input and equipment costs have largely stabilised over the past year. In fact, the reduction in GST and improved domestic supply chains have helped offset earlier cost pressures. Across the industry, scale efficiencies and better value engineering are enabling developers to optimize overall project costs,” Sehgal said.

Sachdeva from ICRA says project costs have generally trended downward and the growth in funding to the sector seems to be primarily driven by capacity additions taking place at a faster pace.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies agrees renewable power deal with Google for Ohio data centres:
[TEXT]
Oil major TotalEnergies has agreed a 15-year power purchase deal to supply Alphabet's Google with 1.5 terawatt hours of renewable electricity from its Montpelier solar farm in Ohio, the French company said on Wednesday.

The solar facility, which is nearing completion, is connected to the PJM grid, the largest in the United States, and will help power Google’s data centre operations in the state, it said.

"This agreement illustrates TotalEnergies’s ability to meet the growing energy demands of major tech companies by leveraging its integrated portfolio of renewable and flexible assets," said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables and Power at TotalEnergies.

The company's growing investment in electricity is helping the company secure a steadier revenue stream and avoid the boom-and-bust cycles typical of oil and gas, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said earlier this month at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi.

The Paris-listed firm is deploying a 10 gigawatt portfolio in the United States, with onshore solar, wind and battery storage projects.
