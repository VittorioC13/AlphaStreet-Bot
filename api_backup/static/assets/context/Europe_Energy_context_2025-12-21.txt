[TITLE]$60 Oil Is No Longer a Floor:
[TEXT]
Brent is clinging to $60 per barrel, but markets have become even less sensitive to geopolitical risk.

Friday, December 19, 2025

Things are not looking good for oil, with Trump’s belligerent rhetoric vis-à-vis Venezuela only pushing ICE Brent futures to $60 per barrel after a slide below that psychological threshold earlier in the week. Sanctions against Russia or threats thereof have by now desensitized the market towards Russian supply risks, once again demonstrated by the lack of price movements after Ukraine targeted another shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean. Against this background, oil could easily end the year below $60.

Trump Launches Full Blockade of Venezuela. US President Trump has ordered a 'complete blockade' of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, ratcheting up pressure after the seizure of the Skipper VLCC, even though PDVSA loadings remain around 800,000 b/d so far in December.

Ukraine Strikes Russia’s Shadow Fleet Tanker. Ukrainian drones have struck an Oman-flagged shadow fleet tanker used in Russia’s oil exports in the southern part of the Mediterranean Sea, some 1,250 miles from Ukraine, with the Baltic Sea-bound vessel sustaining critical damage, according to media reports.

Brazil's Upstream Roiled by Petrobras Strike. Brazil's trade union FUP has been gradually extending its strike over retirement fund payments and wage demands, now impacting Petrobras' (NYSE:PBR) offshore oil platforms just as the country's output posted an all-time high of 4.03 million b/d in October.

Pemex Fails to Attract Oil Majors. Mexico's state oil firm Pemex has awarded five of the 11 JV contracts it anticipated to sign, attracting private companies to bolster production at mature oil fields; however, weak bidding and the lack of foreign participation will only allow for an output lift of 75,000 b/d.

Israel Approves Giant Egypt Gas Deal (At Last). The Israeli government has approved a $35 billion natural gas supply deal with Egypt from the Leviathan gas field, initially signed in September, however, held up by Tel Aviv for more than three months over alleged 1979 peace treaty violations by Egypt.

IEA Sees Coal Demand Plateauing in 2025. The International Energy Agency stated that global coal demand has reached a plateau as they expect supply to trend flat around 9.1 billion tonnes, claiming China will curb its consumption of coal from 2026 onwards as it already started to cut back on imports.

US Allows Sakhalin Sales for the Next 6 Months. The US Treasury Department has extended a waiver allowing oil sales from Russia's Sakhalin-2 project through 18 June 2026, a critical move for its Northeast Asian ally Japan as it sources 9% of its LNG needs from the Gazprom-operated project.

BP CEO Resigns as the Major's Succession Collapses. UK oil major BP (NYSE:BP) has announced the abrupt departure of its CEO Murray Auchincloss and the hiring of Meg O'Neill from Woodside Energy as their next chief executive, the first external hire for the post of BP CEO in more than a century.

Mali's Gold Supply Returns to Normal. Canadian miner Barrick Mining has officially resumed operational control over the Loulo-Gounkoto mine in Mali, ending two years of negotiations that saw several arrests and led to Barrick agreeing to a settlement of $430 million under Mali's new mining code.

Lake Charles LNG Hits the Emergency Brake. US midstream giant Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) has suspended the development of its 16.5 mtpa Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana, saying it would rather 'focus on allocating capital to its backlog of natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects'.

US Passes Bill to Expedite Huge Energy Projects. The US House of Representatives approved a bill this week that would speed up environmental reviews and government permitting for large energy infrastructure projects and data centers, the first notable amendment to the 1969 Nixon-era NEPA Act.

Trump Tightens the Noose Around Iranian Oil. The US Department of Treasury sanctioned another 29 tankers and their management firms for alleged transportation of Iranian petroleum products, taking the total of sanctioned ships to more than 180 since Trump returned to office in January 2025.

Libya's Oil Firms Sell Oil in Defiance of State. Libyan upstream companies have started to sell their crude directly to Western buyers, bypassing the central government and state oil firm NOC, using a Gaddafi-era legal clause that allows ad hoc sales in case they're used to cover 'special funding needs'.

[TITLE]Putin Lashes Out as EU Agrees to Loan $105 Billion to Ukraine:
[TEXT]
The international gold and foreign exchange reserves held by the world’s biggest oil-producing nations in the EU could be at risk, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday, after EU leaders discussed using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine.

“This is not just a blow to its image; it is an undermining of trust in the euro zone,” Putin said in year-end remarks to the Russian press, as carried by Reuters.

“The fact is that many countries keep their gold and foreign exchange reserves in the euro zone, not only Russia but first and foremost the oil-producing countries,” the Russian president added.

After marathon talks this week, the European Union decided early on Friday to provide a loan to Ukraine of 90 billion euros, or $105 billion, for the years 2026-2027 based on EU borrowing on the capital markets backed by the EU budget headroom. This loan will help Ukraine fund its defense against Russia but will not come from the frozen Russian assets.

A seizure of Russian assets, or “robbery” as Putin put it, needs to be canceled or it would have grave consequences for EU member states, according to the Russian President.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump is said to be pushing for a U.S.-brokered deal by Christmas.

Earlier this week, the U.S. and Ukraine both signaled progress in negotiations about a peace agreement during talks in German capital city of Berlin. Washington is now reportedly offering Ukraine security guarantees modeled on NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense pledge.

However, key issues about territory remain unresolved, and Putin has signaled he wants all occupied territory.

At the annual press conference, Putin said on Friday that Russia does not believe Ukraine is ready for peace talks.

Despite the peace talks, Russia prepares for “the coming year as a year of war,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week.

The United States is reportedly considering a fresh barrage of sanctions against Russia’s oil exports if Putin rejects a peace agreement for Ukraine.

[TITLE]Alaska’s $44 billion bet on natural gas:
[TEXT]
An arctic wind cut across Prudhoe Bay, sending spindrifts swirling as Energy Secretary Chris Wright stepped onto a podium hastily erected among oil wells and pump stations. The gray summer sunlight scattered over ice-rimmed ponds, shadows gathering in the hollows of low heaves and stretching over the tundra. But the visitors gathered around him were less interested in the scenery than what lay beneath it.

Wearing a hard hat perched above a pair of safety glasses, Wright gripped a lectern with red-knuckled hands chilled by the cold air. “I want to say to all of you standing here today,” he told a gaggle of oil workers, “you are the greatest liberators in human history.”

From left: U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan takes a selfie with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, an energy worker, and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.

Andrew King / DOI

Hovering nearby were Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Lee Zeldin, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. It was the kind of Cabinet-level entourage that made the remote industrial site feel like a campaign stop. They were on a multiday tour of northern Alaska, hyping plans for a pipeline that would carry liquified natural gas, or LNG, roughly 800 miles south to an export terminal on Cook Inlet. If built, it would be one of the largest infrastructure projects in U.S. history.

Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has focused on “unleashing Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential.” He has hailed the liquid natural gas project — an idea that has been kicking around since the 1960s — as “truly spectacular.” It has become a centerpiece of his energy agenda, even as scientists warn that emissions must fall to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Proponents like Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy extoll the economic benefits the pipeline will bring to Alaska and the energy security it will provide to allies. But the cost is staggering: Official estimates put it at $44 billion, though independent analysts suggest it could top $70 billion. Experts say it has required substantial government support to develop and will require “a mix of public and private capital to move forward.”

The loan is repayable in one installment, and the term of the loan agreement is 31.03.2034. The Bank has the right to repay the loan early with the permission of the Financial Supervision Authority after 5 years have passed since it was issued.

In the form of a subordinated loan agreement, it is a capital instrument included in the Bank's Tier 2 own funds.

According to Paavo Truu, CFO of Coop Pank AS, the funds from the subordinated loan agreement will be used to continue the Bank's growth strategy by directing the funds primarily to projects promoting energy efficiency or renewable energy production. This is the second time the Bank has raised capital from the EEEF; on the first occasion, the Bank obtained a subordinated loan of 15 million euros from the EEEF under an agreement concluded in 2023.

Coop Pank, based on Estonian capital, is one of the five universal banks operating in Estonia. The number of clients using Coop Pank for their daily banking reached 225,800. Coop Pank aims to put the synergy generated by the interaction of retail business and banking to good use and to bring everyday banking services closer to people’s homes. The strategic shareholder of the bank is the domestic retail chain Coop Eesti, comprising of 320 stores.

[TITLE]3 Nuclear Power Stocks Set to Flourish in 2026 on AI Data Center Boom:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered data centers are now booming. The AI infrastructure space remains rock solid, supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Research firm McKinsey & Co. has estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.

The energy-hungry AI space has made nuclear energy one of the hottest industries on Wall Street over the past year. Nuclear energy is increasingly recognized as a key solution to meeting rising global electricity demand and shifting toward cleaner energy sources. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported that the U.S. data center electricity demand is expected to climb to 35 gigawatts (GW) in 2030 from 19 GW in 2023.

To strengthen the nation’s nuclear sector, President Donald Trump has issued four executive orders aimed at modernizing regulatory frameworks, expediting reactor testing and approvals, leveraging nuclear technology for national security, and expanding the domestic nuclear industrial base. These measures target an increase in U.S. nuclear capacity from

[TITLE]VCI Global Expands Upstream into Energy Infrastructure With Up to 250MW Solar Initiative Positioned to Supply AI Data Centres in Malaysia:
[TEXT]
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VCI Energy Sdn Bhd (“VCI Energy” or the “Company”), a renewable energy platform managed and controlled by VCI Global Limited (NASDAQ: VCIG) (“VCI Global”), today announced a major strategic expansion into infrastructure-scale energy following the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with DPS Energy Sdn Bhd (“DPS Energy”), a wholly owned subsidiary of DPS Resources Berhad (“DPS Resources”) (KLSE: DPS), a public listed company listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia to develop a utility-scale solar photovoltaic platform of up to 250 megawatts on approximately 600 acres of long-tenure land at Lipat Kajang, Bukit Apit II, Mukim Sungai Siput, Malacca, Malaysia.

This initiative marks a significant milestone for VCI Global in collaboration with DPS Resources, a Malaysian-listed engineering and energy company with established capabilities in renewable development and project execution. The project positions VCI Global deeper within the energy layer of the AI and data centre value chain, supporting the accelerating build-out of hyperscale data centres and AI-driven digital infrastructure across Malaysia.

Built for Data Centres, AI & Long-Term Power Demand

The project is being structured as an infrastructure-grade renewable energy platform capable of supporting up to 250 MW of installed solar capacity, with estimated annual generation of approximately 350 to 450 gigawatt-hours (GWh), subject to final design and grid conditions. The platform is intended to support long-term power purchase agreements with utilities, industrial users, and data centre operators, while remaining future-ready for battery energy storage system integration.

Demand for data centre power offtake is increasing, driven by the rapid growth of AI and cloud workloads. VCI Global has confirmed that data centre offtake arrangements and adjacent AI infrastructure development are under active evaluation, reflecting strong commercial interest and aligning with the Company’s strategy to support the digital economy through energy and platform-based assets.

Long-Term Infrastructure Value and Revenue Visibility

At full scale, utility-grade solar assets of this size are typically valued at approximately US$0.8 to 1.2 million per megawatt, implying an indicative gross project value of US$200 to 300 million upon full development and commissioning.

Based on industry-standard assumptions for solar irradiation, capacity utilisation, and long-term power purchase agreements with tenors of up to 20 years, the project is designed to generate approximately 350 to 450 (GWh) annually. This equates to an indicative annual gross revenue of US$18 to 24 million and potential cumulative contracted revenue of US$360 to 480 million over a 20-year operating life, subject to final tariff structures, grid connection approvals, and offtake arrangements.

Aligned With Malaysia’s AI, Data Center & Energy Policy Tailwinds

Malaysia is rapidly emerging as a regional hub for hyperscale data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure, supported by strong government policy, expanding semiconductor manufacturing, and increasing commitments by global technology leaders. The country has set national targets to raise renewable energy capacity to 31% by 2025 and 40% by 2035, reinforcing long-term structural demand for large-scale renewable energy platforms. VCI Global believes renewable energy availability is becoming a critical gating factor for data center expansion, and this project positions the Company as a key enabler of Malaysia’s AI-driven digital economy.

“This is not just a solar project; it is an infrastructure platform. As AI, cloud computing, and hyperscale data centres expand across Malaysia, access to large, reliable, and renewable power is becoming mission critical. This initiative marks a decisive step in positioning VCI Global upstream in the energy layer that powers the digital economy,” said Dato’ Victor Hoo, Group Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VCI Global.

An arctic wind cut across Prudhoe Bay, sending spindrifts swirling as Energy Secretary Chris Wright stepped onto a podium hastily erected among oil wells and pump stations. The gray summer sunlight scattered over ice-rimmed ponds, shadows gathering in the hollows of low heaves and stretching over the tundra. But the visitors gathered around him were less interested in the scenery than what lay beneath it.

Wearing a hard hat perched above a pair of safety glasses, Wright gripped a lectern with red-knuckled hands chilled by the cold air. “I want to say to all of you standing here today,” he told a gaggle of oil workers, “you are the greatest liberators in human history.”

Hovering nearby were Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Lee Zeldin, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. It was the kind of Cabinet-level entourage that made the remote industrial site feel like a campaign stop. They were on a multiday tour of northern Alaska, hyping plans for a pipeline that would carry liquified natural gas, or LNG, roughly 800 miles south to an export terminal on Cook Inlet. If built, it would be one of the largest infrastructure projects in U.S. history.

Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has focused on “unleashing Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential.” He has hailed the liquid natural gas project — an idea that has been kicking around since the 1960s — as “truly spectacular.” It has become a centerpiece of his energy agenda, even as scientists warn that emissions must fall to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Proponents like Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy extoll the economic benefits the pipeline will bring to Alaska and the energy security it will provide to allies. But the cost is staggering: Official estimates put it at $44 billion, though independent analysts suggest it could top $70 billion. Experts say it has required substantial government support to develop and will require “a mix of public and private capital to move forward.”

[TITLE]California Cuts PG&E’s and Edison’s Profits for Grid Investments:
[TEXT]
California regulators reduced the profit that utilities are allowed to make on infrastructure investments in an effort to rein in soaring electricity bills.

Related: Massive Wildfire Liabilities Push Utilities to Use AI to Stop Blazes

The move Thursday by the California Public Utilities Commission underscores its oft-conflicting policy goals: while the state is keen for power providers to fortify a grid that’s sparked catastrophic wildfires, doing so costs billions of dollars. Those expenses are typically passed on by utilities owned by PG&E Corp., Edison International and Sempra to homes and businesses. State regulators are also trying to minimize further inflation of utility bills.

On a 4-1 vote, returns for PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — the state’s main investor-owned utilities — were set at a range of 9.78% to 10.03% compared to the national average of about 9.72%.

PG&E had asked for 11.3%, SoCal Edison wanted 11.75% and SDG&E called for 11.25%.
