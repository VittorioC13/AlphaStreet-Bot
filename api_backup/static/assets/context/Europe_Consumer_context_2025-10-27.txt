Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE:BEN), operating as Franklin Templeton, recently closed on its acquisition of Apera Asset Management. The deal augments the global investment management company's alternatives platform and increases its presence in Europe's lower middle market.

With offices in Munich, Paris and Luxembourg, London-based Apera is a pan-European private credit firm with 5 billion euros ($5.868 billion) under management, according to a news release from Franklin Templeton.

Opportunities abound in Europe's lower middle market, according to a blog post from the CFA Institute. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy, representing 99% of the European Union's 32.3 million enterprises, but they've been operating under constrained bank lending.

"The acquisition of Apera reflects our continued commitment to building a world-class global alternatives platform," said Jenny Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton, when the acquisition was announced in June 2025. "We are pleased to welcome Apera's outstanding team and believe our combined capabilities will deliver even greater value to clients globally."

Franklin Templeton Positioned to Dominate Private Credit Market

Acquiring Apera grew Franklin Templeton's alternative credit assets under management to $90 billion. That pushed the firm's total alternative AUM to about $270 billion, bolstering its position as a leading manager of alternative assets.

The private credit market, where private lenders bypass banks and the public to provide capital directly to companies, is a fast-expanding segment of the financial industry. In a January 2025 research note, Moody's said it expects private credit AUM to jump to $3 trillion by 2028.

Apera will complement Franklin Templeton's existing global alternative credit offerings, further diversifying the firm's geographic exposure and capabilities within the private credit asset class, according to the firm's news release in June.

What Is Apera?

Apera was founded in 2016 and provides senior secured private capital to private equity-backed companies in Western Europe. The company is dedicated to supporting mid-market companies, specifically those in the lower middle market that have strong cash flow, market leadership and support from private equity sponsors. Apera provides financing strategies and services to investors, sponsors and companies to help businesses grow.

[TITLE]IPO-bound MTR parent Orkla bets on ‘local’ as rivals go for national play:
[TEXT]
Mumbai: Norwegian conglomerate Orkla, which owns ready-to-cook and spices brands MTR, Great Eastern and Rasoi Magic, will stay focused on growing its brands in their home states and catering to local consumer preferences as their primary driver of growth, Orkla India's chief executive officer Sanjay Sharma said.

“Unlike large companies that tend to take their brands across multiple nations… we believe in ‘local’," Sharma told Mint. “Even in Europe we’ve seen that tastes between Norway and Sweden change, even though they are very similar in culture."

Sharma said Orkla's success has been in recognizing growth opportunity in India’s foods business by accepting that the country is a collection of many cultures that must be addressed with individually tailored brands, rather than attempting to build a pan-India national brand.

“The business model we have implemented in India is pretty similar to the model we ran in Europe as well," he said. “In the Scandinavian region, our business has been a collection of family-run businesses. We realized that family-run businesses are local in nature and meet consumer needs much more efficiently and in an agile manner than larger companies. I think this is because they are more intuitive and they understand the local consumers very well, they’re more connected to the consumers."

Orkla entered India in 2007 by acquiring Karnataka-based foods and spices brand MTR Foods from the founding family; in 2020, it acquired Kerala-based spices brand Great Eastern founded by the Meerans.

Next week, the company will launch its public issue worth ₹1,667.54 crore; all of it is an offer for sale in which shareholders Orkla Asia Pacific Pte, along with Great Eastern founder Navas and Feroz Meeran, will offload shares. In FY25, Orkla India recorded revenues from operation worth ₹2,394.7 crore, up 1.7% year-on-year while profit after tax was at ₹255.7 crore, up nearly 13%.

The competition landscape

Orkla India remains focused on the southern Indian markets, where MTR and Great Eastern are strongest, even as large consumer packaged goods companies such as ITC and Tata Consumer attempt to build national brands in packaged spices and ready-to-cook segments.

In 2020, ITC acquired east India-based spices brand Sunrise Foods for ₹2,150 crore. Sunrise is dominant in Assam and has grown in West Bengal as well, ITC Foods’ executive director Hemant Malik told Mint earlier this year.

ITC also sells spices nationwide under its Aashirvaad brand, best known for packaged atta (wholewheat flour). In 2023, Dabur Ltd acquired north India-focused Badshah Masala, while Wipro Consumer Care acquired Kerala-based spice brand Nirapara a year earlier. Tata has been selling spices under the consumer staples brand Sampann for a decade; it also sells spices under private label brand bb, owned by BigBasket.

India’s packaged staples market was worth ₹3.7 trillion in 2024 and is set to grow to over ₹6 trillion by 2029, Orkla said in its IPO documents. Much of the growth in spices comes from customers converting from unbranded, loose spices sold in markets to branded, packaged goods and from focusing on getting a share of customers' daily consumption, Sharma said.

While Orkla has expanded MTR from Karnataka to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, it took more than a decade for the brand to get a foothold in those markets, he added. Acquisitions will remain important to Orkla's growth strategy.

[TITLE]The Simply Good Foods Company Reports Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results and Provides Fiscal Year 2026 Outlook:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Simply Good Foods Company (Nasdaq: SMPL) (“Simply Good Foods,” or the “Company”), a leader in the Nutritional Snacking category, today reported financial results for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025. The acquisition of Only What You Need, Inc. ("OWYN") was completed on June 13, 2024. Therefore, the Company's year-ago performance for the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, did not include results for the OWYN business for the full period. As we have now passed the anniversary date of the OWYN acquisition, the use of "organic" will refer to growth for brands the Company has owned for more than twelve months on a comparable basis. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2025, "organic" includes year-over-year growth for Simply Good Foods' business excluding the period of time prior to the closing of the OWYN acquisition, as well as the impacts of lapping the extra week in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2024.

Fourth Quarter Summary:(1)

Net sales of $369.0 million versus $375.7 million

Net loss of $12.4 million versus net income of $29.3 million

Loss per diluted share of $0.12 versus earnings per diluted share of $0.29

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) (2) of $0.46 versus $0.50

Adjusted EBITDA(3) $66.2 million versus $77.5 million

Fiscal Year 2026(4) Outlook:

Net sales expected to range between -2% and +2% year-over-year

Gross margins expected to decline between 100 and 150 basis points year-over-year

Adjusted EBITDA expected to range between -4% and +1% year-over-year

“Fiscal year 2025 finished with solid results, with net sales up 9% on a reported basis and 3% Adjusted EBITDA growth. Organic net sales grew 3%, driven by continued strong double-digit consumption for both Quest and OWYN. We largely completed the integration of OWYN, invested meaningfully in our brands and capabilities despite inflationary pressures, and leveraged our strong cash flow to improve our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders," said Geoff Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Simply Good Foods. "Our vision is to be the scaled leader in high protein, low sugar and low carb food and beverage products, where growth is being fueled by a generational shift in consumer eating habits that continues to mainstream. We will achieve this through our simple growth framework of world class innovation, expanding physical availability of our products across the store and online, and through breakthrough marketing to build awareness for our brands. We are building an organization that combines the agility and speed of an insurgent challenger with the advantages of scaled selling and supply chain capabilities, a necessary operating model in an increasingly dynamic marketplace."

"Our outlook for fiscal year 2026 balances our long-term ambition, continued growth expectations for Quest and OWYN and the benefits from productivity, pricing and investments in our brands, against the two important challenges of reduced distribution for Atkins and cost pressures from inflation and tariffs. Even as we face these headwinds, we are taking the right actions for our portfolio, for the category, and for our Company to enable sustainable growth and to create shareholder value for years to come.”

Fourth Quarter 2025 Results(1)

Net sales of $369.0 million decreased $6.6 million, or 1.8%, versus the year ago period driven by a 6.9% headwind from lapping the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Organic growth was a 3.5% benefit, while the OWYN Acquisition contributed $5.6 million, or 1.5%, to reported net sales growth.

Shares of United Breweries are likely to be in focus on Thursday after parent company Heineken NV reported a mid-single-digit decline in beer volumes in India for the September quarter, even as net revenue rose in the same range on the back of strong pricing, improved portfolio mix, and robust growth in premium brands like Kingfisher Ultra Max and Amstel Grande Heineken said India’s performance in the quarter was hit by “an unusually strong monsoon season” that dented beer consumption, though price hikes in key states and a favourable product mix helped offset the impact. “In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,” the company said in its earnings statement.Despite weaker overall volumes, Heineken highlighted that its premium beer segment — typically priced above Rs 125 per pint — “grew in the low teens,” driven by the strong performance of Kingfisher Ultra Max and the launch of Amstel Grande. United Breweries’ domestic revenue growth mirrored this trend, supported by its expanding premium portfolio.In 2025, heavier-than-usual rainfall across several states during July and August weighed on consumer demand and disrupted supply chains, a challenge echoed across India’s broader consumer goods sector. United Breweries managed to navigate the softer quarter through price-led growth and by deepening its focus on high-margin brands.Across Heineken’s Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, organic net revenue rose 5.6%, though consolidated volume slipped 0.8%. The Dutch brewer reported total revenue of 8.7 billion euros in the September quarter, down 4% year-on-year. Globally, Heineken’s organic beer volume declined 4.3%, as gains in markets like Africa and the Middle East were offset by lower sales in Europe and the Americas.“We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,” Heineken said, highlighting India’s relative resilience within its global footprint.Heineken holds a 61.5% stake in United Breweries, which remains a dominant player in India’s beer market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black, Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium. The company also distributes international labels including Heineken, Amstel Bier, and Sol under the Dutch brewer’s global portfolio.: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

[TITLE]These self-made millionaires dish on the 5 habits that helped them to retire early — are you undermining your efforts?:
[TEXT]
Homes have a tendency to appreciate in value, so you could potentially make the argument for buying one that’s a bit more expensive since you may be able to sell it at a profit.

Read more: Warren Buffett says you can't buy time — but real estate investors have found this 1 loophole . See how they’re buying back hundreds of hours a year (for absolutely free)

Anything you can do to keep housing costs down will go a long way in your effort to invest and retire early, so be sure to shop around for the best mortgage price before you commit to buying a property.

If you’re looking to buy a home, aim for one that’s less expensive than the maximum that you can afford. Or, buy your dream home, but rent out a spare bedroom so your tenants can help pay off your mortgage.

There’s a decent chance that housing will end up being your largest monthly expense — and the less you spend on it, the more you might have to save and invest.

Meanwhile, Zillow puts today’s average monthly rent payment for all bedroom and property types at $2,001 as of mid-October. (4)

In July, the national median mortgage payment was $2,127, which is down $45 from June, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. (3)

Here are five particular habits they say allowed them to retire early. (2)

Business Insider recently interviewed several people who managed to achieve financial independence at a relatively young age.

If your goal is to retire early, saving and investing at a young age is key, and the right financial habits can make saving money a lot easier.

You may, however, need to save a lot more than that if you want to retire early. While it’s one thing to have a nest egg that lasts 20 to 30 years, stretching your retirement savings for 40 or 50 years is a very different story.

Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how

It’s also a common target for a retirement goal. A recent Northwestern Mutual study found that Americans think it will take $1.26 million to have a comfortable retirement in 2025. (1)

Story Continues

Cars, on the other hand, mostly depreciate in value. And if you’re able to keep your vehicle costs low, you’ll have that much more money to invest for retirement. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price for a new car was $49,077 as of August 2025. Meanwhile, the average price for a used car was $25,393. (5)

If you’re willing to drive a used car with fewer frills, you could end up saving a bundle over time.

Of course, keeping your car costs low includes keeping your yearly insurance price tag within your budget, too. Shopping around for a deal with OfficialCarInsurance.com could help you to save hundreds each year.

As insurance prices rise — and CNBC reports (6) that the average cost of full coverage policies has increased 50% since 2020 — you will want to maximize your savings on your insurance, while still getting comprehensive coverage from trusted insurers like Progressive, GEICO and Allstate.

OfficialCarInsurance.com helps you instantly sort through the best policies from car insurance providers in your area. To get started, fill in your information and get a list of the top insurers in your area in minutes.

Keep in mind that you can typically change your insurance policy before it’s up for renewal, just look out for any early cancellation fees.

3. Cook most of your meals at home

The average restaurant markup on menu items is typically 200% to 300% of the total food costs, depending on different factors, according to SpotOn. (7)

That makes sense, since restaurants have other overhead costs to cover and need to turn a profit. But if you’re willing to cook most of your meals at home, you could save a lot of money compared to the cost of dining out or ordering in.

And that’s money you can put into an investment portfolio for your retirement.

However, saving money is only half the battle. You need to be able to set and stick to a budget. To do that, you need to be able to track your expenses easily, and understand how you spend your money month-to-month. One way to make your daily tracking habit simple is to use Monarch Money.

This financial management platform offers an all-in-one tool to help you track investments, spending and budgeting, and even offers personalized advice so you can feel confident

Importing Europe’s drug price controls means importing Europe’s drug shortages

American Thinker ^ | 10/25/25 | David Hogberg

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Last Thursday, EMD Serono became the latest pharmaceutical company, after Pfizer and AstraZeneca, to agree to a deal with the Trump Administration to reduce the prices of its drugs. Under these deals the companies must sell their drugs to the federal government at the “Most Favored Nation” price.

Under the Most Favored Nation system, the price pharmaceutical companies can charge for a drug is equal to the lowest price among selected high-income countries. Many of those countries are in Europe, where they have lower drug prices because they impose price controls.

The Trump Administration is trying to address public frustration with high drug prices. However, what Most Favored Nation drug prices mean, in effect, is the federal government will import European price controls. The rub is that it can’t do that without also importing the biggest problem caused by price controls, namely shortages.

For patients, drug shortages can cause anxiety, poor health, and even death. In August 2024 David Allen, a military veteran in the United Kingdom, said he was living “day-to-day” because he was struggling to get a supply of Creon. Allen’s pancreas no longer makes the enzymes needed to digest food, the result of his treatment for pancreatic cancer four years earlier. Creon replaces the missing enzymes. Without it, Allen would end up in the hospital with a feeding tube. Allen said it was depressing and frightening when the Creon starts “running out and you haven’t got a clue where the next supply is going to come from.”

Yeah sure. America can only have access to medications if they can sodomize America by charging us 10x or 20x s they do other customers. Go sell that story somewhere else.

“Under the Most Favored Nation system, the price pharmaceutical companies can charge for a drug is equal to the lowest price among selected high-income countries. Many of those countries are in Europe, where they have lower drug prices because they impose price control” Ok… America is the far bigger market and consumes far more of those drugs. If they want those big profits, they can cut off those rich European countries that have price controls and tester their MFN baseline price. Problem solved.

Simple fix. MFNations’ clause only applies for drugs made outside the US. One to two sentences in the tariff and the issue is moot.

[TITLE]Whose New York is it? The ‘affordability’ question in the mayoral race exposes deep fault lines:
[TEXT]
Nakeeta Wills pieces together what she can to afford staying in New York City.

A health insurance advisor, Wills relies on a local garden and food pantries to help pay for groceries. Grandparents and “loving aunties” help pay for her 10-year-old son playing violin. Wills took out student loans for a master’s program in business and owes at least $100,000.

Her rent is somewhat reasonable — by New York standards. She pays $1,300 per month for an apartment in Central Harlem, but her son is getting older and bigger. She thinks she’ll need more amenities as she ages too, like a doorman or perhaps an elevator.

Wills checks the city’s affordable housing portal every day, but she doesn’t qualify for many of the units on the site — even though the high cost of living in Manhattan feels out of reach, and her income barely lets her scrape by. She’s even considered leaving the city — for upstate, Maryland or the South — but always decides to stay.

“There’s no real middle ground for somebody who makes the $50K in New York,” Wills said. “There’s just like, nothing here. Can’t do nothing. I can’t apply for no program.”

“I should be able to live comfortably here, and any candidate that supports [that] would definitely get my vote. I’m not here looking for a handout. I am no stranger to hard work,” she added, saying people shouldn’t need to “have nothing in order to get some type of support.”

The challenge Wills and other New Yorkers face has propelled the issue of affordability into the forefront of this year’s mayoral election. If crime and post-Covid recovery were top of mind for voters four years ago, the 2025 election has become a referendum on a more fundamental question:

Can New York can work for anyone but the super wealthy?

With early voting starting this weekend and candidates making their final pitches to voters, many New Yorkers are preparing to cast their ballots based in part on who they think would do the best job of tackling an unprecedented affordability crisis — in which rent has reached record highs, and the annual cost of child care is over $20,000.

Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner, has positioned himself as the affordability candidate, running on a platform that includes rent freezes and free daycare. His focus on pocketbook issues was widely credited for his upset victory over Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, in the primary, and has shaped the contours of the race as it nears its conclusion.

Cuomo and GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa have taken note, with each pushing affordability platforms of their own, particularly on housing.

More than 21% of the city’s likely voters said last month affordability was the most important issue that will affect their vote, followed by crime and the economy or jobs, according to a poll from Suffolk University CityView.

Child care, rent emerge as key issues

Skye Monson, 40, is among those voters. A floral designer at an event design and production company, she lives with her fiancé, a musician and small business owner, and their toddler in a 1-bedroom apartment in Red Hook. They all share a Queen-size bed, as the cost of living continues to rise.

“It just seems to be going up and up and up,” Monson said.

The couple pays $2,850 per month for rent, which is

[TITLE]Is Sustainability Still Worth It? Fashion Industry, Supply Chain Say Resounding Yes:
[TEXT]
VENICE, Italy — As sustainability faces disruption and political backlash globally, fashion finds itself questioning how to move the needle forward after a decade of quantum leap efforts.

Against a dampened economy and geopolitical turmoil, the stakes are higher than ever.

Global supply chains, including Italy’s, are under pressure — and increasingly under scrutiny. Policymakers are navigating the complexity of dealing with a different world — and business views. The performance of the fashion sector is still iffy and the outlook hard to predict.

“The issue at hand concerns the models we want to champion for the future, the vision of the world we want to embrace,” said Vittorio Emanuele Parsi, international relations professor at Milan’s Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, at the fourth two-day edition of the Venice Sustainable Fashion Forum held here at the Fondazione Cini.

“This is the time to have the courage to face our era head-on,” echoed Carlo Cottarelli, director of the program for education in economic and social sciences and of the observatory on Italian public accounts at the same university.

Industry players at the forum recognized the importance of scaling up, rather than back, their efforts and of doing so collaboratively.

“Not only Made in Italy fashion is under attack. The reality is that it’s part of a much broader ecosystem, one we share with our European partners. This is a multifaceted attack,” said Luca Sburlati, president of Confindustria Moda, in reference to the many pressing issues faced by the sector.

“We are working within a model where ethics, economy and innovation are all evolving rapidly, so it’s crucial that we take center stage in this discussion and make decisions to bring to the attention of the policymakers,” he said.

The Italian association was among the organizers of the event alongside Confindustria Veneto Est and consultancy The European House Ambrosetti, or TEHA Group.

A study by the latter titled “Just Fashion Transition 2025,” provided a candid picture of where the fashion sector stands in its eco-journey.

Drawing from data by the European Environment Agency, the research said that the EU fashion sector has cut 37 percent of its carbon emissions since 1990.

An additional 18 percent is still required to comply with the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles for 2030, which the consultancy estimates would require at least 4.4 billion euros.

“The cost of waiting is higher than the cost of taking action,” said Carlo Cici, partner and head of sustainability practices at TEHA Group. “When it comes to sustainability, waiting is not a viable strategy for growth,” he added, sparking applause from the audience.

Making his point, Cici said that biodiversity and the health of natural ecosystems are crucial enablers of growth as

Shares of KPR Mill Gokaldas Exports and other textile stocks climbed up to 13% in morning trade on Thursday, October 23, as investors pinned hopes on a possible breakthrough in the highly anticipated India-US trade deal This comes after US President Donald Trump said he loves India and both countries are working on a trade deal. The President had phoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to wish Happy Diwali. The development gains significance as Donald Trump recently said that negotiations for a trade deal with India were underway. On Tuesday, Trump also said he had received assurance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call that New Delhi would scale back purchases of Russian oil.In the morning, Gokaldas Exports led the surge, rallying 13% to their day’s high of Rs 899 per share. K.P.R Mill gained 6.5% to its day high of Rs 1,090 per share on the NSE. Raymond Lifestyle shares surged to its day high of Rs 1,246, or 4.2% from the last close. Pearly Global rallied as much as 7% to an intra-day high of Rs 1,403. Indo Count also gained 7% to its day high of Rs 288 per share on the NSE. Welspun Living soared 8% to Rs 132 per share.Other major triggers that could benefit the textile majors include the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The deal is expected to aid textile exporters by removing the 10–12% duty that had previously hurt them against competitors. The deal now gives India parity with Cambodia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which already enjoy duty-free access.In addition, the new GST rate on readymade garments priced up to Rs 2,500 has been reduced to 5% from 12%. Man-made fibres, yarns, handloom, handicrafts, and carpets will also face a lower uniform rate of 5%.In a recent report, Crisil Ratings said India’s home textile makers could be staring at a 5-10% decline due to Trump tariffs. Companies that derive more than half of their revenue from the US are expected to feel a sharper impact. To counter this, exporters are eyeing the European Union and the UK, which together made up

[TITLE]United States Lobster Market Consumption Patterns and Forecast Report 2025-2033: Growing Consumer Demand for Premium Seafood, Particularly in the Fine Dining, Retail, and Export Segments:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Lobster Market - Consumption Patterns & Forecast 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

United States Lobster Market is expected to reach US$ 3.95 billion by 2033 from US$ 2.07 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 7.44% from 2025 to 2033

Strong consumer demand, growing seafood consumption, and growing export prospects are the market's main drivers. Sustainable fishing methods, improvements in cold storage, and rising demand in the retail and catering industries are important considerations.

Growing consumer demand for premium seafood, particularly in the fine dining, retail, and export segments, is driving the lobster business in the United States. The market is expanding due to rising demand for high-protein diets and rising disposable income. In December 2024, personal income climbed by $92.0 billion (0.4%), while disposable personal income increased by $79.7 billion (0.4%), according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Spending on personal consumption increased by $133.6 billion (0.7%). At a 3.8% saving rate, personal savings totaled $843.2 billion. The PCE price index grew by 0.3% on a monthly basis. Restaurants and seafood franchises that specialize in lobster-based cuisine are part of the significant foodservice industry. Consumer trust is growing as a result of the use of sustainable harvesting methods and certification schemes, which raises demand for lobster that is supplied ethically. Technological developments in processing, storage, and transportation enhance product quality and prolong shelf life.

One of the primary drivers of development is still the demand for exports, especially from China, Europe, and Canada. International sales are impacted by market dynamics that are influenced by trade agreements and tariff reductions. Lobster populations are impacted by climate change and changes in water temperatures, which leads to changes in regulations and restrictions on seasonal harvesting. Wider market penetration is supported by the move toward frozen and value-added lobster goods, such as flesh and tails.

For example, in order to grow its lobster and snow crab operations, Phillips Foods, a significant supplier of crabmeat in the United States, said in March 2024 that it would acquire two processing facilities in Canada, located on Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. At Seafood Expo North America, the business will introduce new chilled pasteurized lobster flesh products and a frozen crab toast appetizer. Online seafood markets and direct-to-consumer sales increase accessibility while accommodating changing customer tastes and buying habits.

Key Factors Driving the United States Lobster Market Growth

Growth in Export Markets

Strong demand from important overseas markets, particularly China, Europe, and Canada, is the primary reason for the healthy growth of the U.S. lobster export business. European demand for lobster is rising, especially in upscale dining establishments and retail chains, while China's middle class is developing and its consumption of premium seafood has expanded the market for U.S. lobster. The Food and Agriculture Organization reports that US live lobster shipments to China increased 69% in volume and 55% in value from Q2 2022 to 830 tons valued at USD 16.25 million in Q2 2023.

In the face of economic uncertainty, tighter supply and high demand might result in price increases even with stable EU imports. In addition to the local supply, U.S. lobster is a major trading partner of Canada. Both trade agreements and tariff reductions are crucial tools for enhancing exporters' market accessibility and bolstering export dynamics. The growth of U.S. lobster is being driven by both overseas sales and the rising demand for seafood abroad.

Rising Demand for Premium Seafood

In the US, there is a growing consumer demand for premium, sustainably farmed lobster. Restaurants, shops, and internet platforms are giving priority to lobster that is obtained sustainably as customers grow more conscious of the effects their food choices have on the environment. Red Lobster, for example, unveiled a redesigned menu in November 2024 that includes seven new dishes and the return of the popular hush puppies. With a 20% reduction in total size, the new menu hopes to appeal to seafood enthusiasts.

Lobsterfest will still give visitors an improved experience even though the well-liked Ultimate Endless Shrimp promotion has ended. Customers seeking ethically sourced products are becoming more and more interested in sustainability certifications and traceability initiatives. Seafood companies are responding by highlighting low-impact fishing methods and approved traps as examples of sustainable harvesting practices. This is further demonstrated by the increased demand for premium lobster goods from eateries, specialty shops, and internet marketplaces that cater to affluent customers prepared to shell out more money for superior, eco-friendly seafood.

Rising E-Commerce and D2C Sales

The expansion of the U.S. lobster market is being transformed by e-commerce and direct-to-consumer sales. According to the Census Bureau, retail e-commerce sales in the United States reached $300.1 billion in Q3 2024, increasing 7.4% year over year and 2.6% from Q2 2024. With $1.84 trillion in total retail sales, Q3 saw a 1.3% gain over Q2. 16.2% of the quarter's total revenues came from e-commerce. Without using the conventional retail route, customers can purchase fresh, frozen, or value-added lobster goods straight from producers through online seafood platforms.

In addition to saving time, this increases product variety and transparency in pricing. With cutting-edge packing that preserves product quality, direct shipping services guarantee a quicker delivery. The demand for premium lobster offers through these digital channels keeps rising as more customers look for gourmet seafood experiences at home. The growing desire for individualized purchasing and easy access to sustainable sourcing methods lend credence to this.

Challenges in the United States Lobster Market

Regulatory and Sustainability Pressures

Stricter laws, including as fishing quotas, size restrictions, and seasonal limitations, have been implemented in response to growing worries
