[TITLE]Rubicon Technology, Inc. to acquire Janel Group LLC:
[TEXT]
BENSENVILLE, Ill. and NEW YORK, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rubicon Technology, Inc. (OTCQB:RBCN) (“Rubicon”) and Janel Corporation (OTCQX:JANL) (“Janel Corp”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which Rubicon will acquire Janel Group LLC (“Janel Group”) with Janel Group becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Rubicon and Janel Corp receiving shares of Rubicon common stock.

Janel Group, based in Garden City, New York, and originally founded in 1974, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Janel Corp. Janel Group had revenues of approximately $181.3 million and operating income of approximately $8.7 million for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2025. The company is a non-asset based, full-service provider of cargo transportation logistics management services. Its management team will remain in place as part of Rubicon.

The transaction allows Rubicon to acquire a profitable business and better access to capital. Janel Corp shareholders will benefit from its ownership of Rubicon.

The transaction, which was approved by the Rubicon board, including its independent directors, is subject to approval by the majority of Rubicon’s disinterested stockholders.

Additional Transaction Details

Janel Corp will sell all of the issued and outstanding equity of Janel Group to Rubicon in exchange for 7,000,000 shares of Rubicon common stock, at a value of $4.75 per share. Rubicon will assume approximately $23 million of Janel Group indebtedness and net working capital liabilities and gain access to a total of $35 million in borrowing capacity as part of a revolving credit facility under Janel Corp’s existing credit line.

Prior to this transaction, Janel Corp owned 1,108,000 shares of Rubicon common stock, representing approximately 46.6 percent of all outstanding Rubicon common stock. Following this transaction, Janel Corp will own approximately 86.5 percent of Rubicon’s common stock. Janel Corp and Rubicon will maintain the existing governance, nomination and voting agreement requiring review and approval by Rubicon’s independent directors of related party transactions between Rubicon and Janel Corp, and any of its affiliates, until such time that Janel Corp and/or its affiliates acquire more than 90 percent of Rubicon’s outstanding stock.

In order to protect Rubicon’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards, Rubicon had previously adopted a stockholder rights plan to limit the ability of any group or person to acquire 5% or more of Rubicon’s common stock (subject to certain exceptions, including acquisitions approved by its board) by any group or person. The board of Rubicon has determined that the transaction will not impair the Rubicon’s net loss carryforwards.

Rubicon shares will continue to be traded on the OTC market.

Janel Corp Tender Offer of Rubicon Common Stock

Contingent upon a successful Rubicon stockholder vote and consummation of the transaction, Janel Corp expects to make a tender offer for an additional 400,000 shares of Rubicon stock at $4.75 per share in cash upon which Janel Corp would own approximately 90.7% of Rubicon’s common stock outstanding.

The tender offer described in this announcement has not yet commenced. This announcement is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell Rubicon’s common stock. If Rubicon stockholders approve the transaction, Janel will distribute an Offer to Purchase relating to the tender offer following the consummation of the transaction, and any Rubicon stockholder who would like to participate in the tender offer should review the terms of the tender offer set forth in such Offer to Purchase when it becomes available.

[TITLE]Nvidia reportedly shows China-specific B30 chips with 80% of the performance of the standard Blackwell GPU to the U.S. government — Nvidia CEO says approval is still up in the air:
[TEXT]
Reports suggest that Nvidia has already presented a B30 chip to the U.S. government for export approval to China. According to the Wall Street Journal, these talks began earlier this year, with the chip’s peak performance reaching only 80% of the standard Blackwell GPU's performance.

President Donald Trump has commented that he will allow Nvidia to ship a Blackwell if it's at least 30% less performant than the company’s top offering. “It is possible I would make a deal [on a] ‘somewhat enhanced in a negative way’ Blackwell processor,” Trump said to reporters. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.” By comparison, the Nvidia HGX H20 is only around 50% of the performance of the full-fat H100, especially in multi-GPU setups.

The U.S. banned the sale of H20 in mid-April, resulting in a $5.5 billion write-off for Nvidia. However, it reversed this decision some three months later by issuing export licenses, allowing the company to resume sales in China in exchange for 15% of its sales in the country. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this was part of the negotiations for China to loosen its grip on rare-earth minerals — a crucial resource required to produce semiconductors, high-tech equipment, and defense technologies.

However, this was soon followed by warnings from Chinese state media saying that the H20 is unsafe and outdated, and the authorities have reportedly discouraged organizations, especially government bodies, from using it. All of this supposedly came from Sec. Lutnick’s abrasive ‘addiction’ comments, which the Chinese leadership called insulting. However, some experts say that Nvidia and its AI chips are being used as a political maneuvering tool by both sides, primarily as China and the U.S. are engaged in a trade war.

“If the U.S. government were to approve a powerful Blackwell for China, even at a 30-to-50% performance reduction,” said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser to RAND Corporation, a think tank with offices in Washington, D.C. “My guess is we’d miraculously see China forget about security concerns.”

This is probably why we’ve seen claims that Nvidia is asking its suppliers to wind down H20 production. The company did not confirm this, though, only telling Tom’s Hardware that it constantly manages its supply chain to match market conditions. Still, the AI giant is working to prepare a next-generation offering for H2O. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has told reporters that the company is in talks with the United States government for this, but that the negotiations are still in the early stages.

We are yet to see if the White House will approve the sales of the B30 chip in its current iteration to China. Nvidia likely needs this to move forward to retain its leadership in the East Asian country, especially as Beijing appears to be successful in encouraging Chinese companies to reduce their reliance on H2O.

The Trump administration is considering equity stakes tied to CHIPS Act awards, but has distinguished its approach based on the company's actions. It signaled that it will not pursue shares in companies that are stepping up U.S. investment. A government official stated the Commerce Department is “not looking to take equity from TSMC and Micron,” clarifying that the equity stake policy differs for various recipients. This eased concerns that Washington would demand ownership across the board.
