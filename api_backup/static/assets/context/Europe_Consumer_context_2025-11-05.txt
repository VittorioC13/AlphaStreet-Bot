[TITLE]Starbucks sells majority stake in China business, valued at $4B:
[TEXT]
Starbucks said Monday it sold a majority stake in its China business to Boyu Capital in a deal that values the business at $4 billion.

Boyu will own a 60% stake in the business, with Starbucks holding the remainder. The coffee chain expects the total value of its China business to surpass $13 billion, including ongoing licensing agreements in the region, along with its remaining stake in the unit.

"Boyu's deep local knowledge and expertise will help accelerate our growth in China, especially as we expand into smaller cities and new regions," CEO Brian Niccol said in the release. "Together we will write the next chapter of Starbucks storied history in China."

Currently, there are 8,011 locations in the region. The company still aims to have 20,000 locations there over time. Over 60% of Starbucks' store base is in the US and China. The deal is expected to be finalized during Starbucks' next fiscal quarter.

In its most recent quarter, global same-store sales at Starbucks rose 1%, a surprise increase against forecasts for a 0.5% decline and the first time in seven quarters the company posted positive global comp sales.

Same-store sales in China rose 2%, a shade less than the 2.2% expected.

Starbucks has deep roots in the region. It opened its first store in Beijing in 1999 and its first Shanghai store in 2000.

From the early 2000s to 2017, the coffee giant expanded through licensing agreements with joint venture partners as it looked to grow its presence in China, which at the time was a largely untapped market.

In 2017, Starbucks decided to bring its operations completely in-house when it bought the remaining 50% share of its East China business from joint venture partners for $1.3 billion.

This decision now marks a reversal in that course.

"Starbucks has built an iconic brand and a deep connection with Chinese consumers over the past 26 years ... This partnership reflects our shared belief in the enduring strength of that brand and the opportunity to bring even greater innovation and local relevance to customers across China," Boyu Capital partner Alex Wong said in the release.

Starbucks stock was up about 0.5% following the announcement.

[TITLE]Musk's $1 Trillion Mega Deal: Will Tesla Shareholders Approve The Jackpot?:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) annual shareholder meeting this week is shaping up less like a corporate vote and more like a referendum on Elon Musk himself. At stake: a $1 trillion stock award that could make Musk the world's first trillionaire — if he hits a series of moonshot goals that would turn Tesla into an $8.5 trillion juggernaut.

A Pay Package That Redefines ‘All Or Nothing'

The proposal, first floated in 2018 and now re-ratified after a legal challenge, would give Musk the right to earn up to 304 million Tesla shares over the next decade if he’s able to sixfold the company's market cap and meets targets like:

selling 20 million cars annually,

rolling out a million robotaxis , and

deploying a million Optimus humanoid robots.

Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Tesla's board, led by chair Robyn Denholm, has been on a media blitz, arguing that dangling a massive equity prize is the only way to keep Musk focused on the automaker rather than his constellation of side ventures — from X to xAI to SpaceX. "He's driven by ambitious targets," Denholm said, warning that Musk could "walk away" if shareholders reject the deal, reported FT.

Shareholders Torn Between Loyalty And Leverage

Not everyone's buying it. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) has already voted against the package, calling it "orders of magnitude" above peers and warning it would "further concentrate power in a single shareholder."

Proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis also oppose it — prompting Musk to fire back, branding them "corporate terrorists." Yet for every institutional critic, there's an army of retail shareholders ready to click "yes," many of whom see Musk's outsized pay as symbolic of Tesla's outsized ambition.

Investor Takeaway

Whether the plan passes or not, the vote underscores Tesla's identity crisis — is it a carmaker, a robotics empire, or an Elon Musk personality cult?

Investors betting on Tesla's long-term story should remember: even if Musk wins his trillion-dollar jackpot, it only pays out if he can deliver on the biggest "if" in corporate history.

Loss from continuing operations was $4.2 million, or a negative 5.2% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $10.4 million, or a negative 16.8% of revenue, for the third quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations 1 : Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.8 million, or 4.6% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the third quarter last year.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.8 million, or 4.6% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the third quarter last year. Active Buyers and Orders: Active Buyers of 1.57 million and Orders of 1.61 million for the third quarter 2025, representing increases of 26% and 37%, respectively, over the third quarter last year.

Financial Outlook

For the fourth quarter 2025, ThredUp expects:

Revenue in the range of $76.0 million to $78.0 million, +14% year-over-year at the midpoint

Gross margin in the range of 78.0% to 79.0%

Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 3.0%

For the full fiscal year 2025, ThredUp expects:

Revenue in the range of $307.0 million to $309.0 million, +18% year-over-year at the midpoint

Gross margin in the range of 79.0% to 79.2%

Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 4.2%

ThredUp is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance of the Non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA margin to net loss margin, the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP because certain items are out of ThredUp’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude, where applicable in a given period, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, severance and other reorganization costs, and gain on sale of non-marketable equity investment. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue for the same period. Accordingly, a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA in order to calculate forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin is not available without unreasonable effort. However, for the fourth quarter of 2025 and full year 2025, Depreciation and amortization is expected to be $3.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively. In addition, for the fourth quarter of 2025 and full year 2025, Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be $3.8 million and $18.3 million, respectively. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could result in projected net loss being materially greater than is indicated by the currently estimated Adjusted EBITDA margin.

ThredUp is not providing a quantitative reconciliation for free cash flow estimates on a forward-looking basis because it is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to provide a meaningful or reasonably accurate calculation or estimation of net cash provided by operating activities and certain reconciling items on a forward-looking basis, which could be significant to the Company's results.

[TITLE]Chalhoub Group Launches Makette, Its First Luxury Brand Venture:
[TEXT]
DUBAI — Chalhoub Group, the luxury retail group that has distributed more than 400 international labels across the Middle East for seven decades, is venturing into brand building with Makette, a modular handbag and leather goods line.

The debut marks a strategic pivot for the family-owned company, expanding beyond its traditional franchise model to create proprietary brands with global ambitions.

Ana Canadas, Chalhoub Group’s director of fashion innovation, pointed to an industry trend: luxury handbag prices have surged 60 to 90 percent since 2019, driven by rising raw material costs and supply chain pressures. Meanwhile, some luxury houses shifted production to lower-cost locations, she claimed, compromising quality even as prices climbed.

“People say the bags their mothers had lasted generations, but ones purchased now break after a couple of years,” Canadas said during an interview revealing the bags for the first timeIn developing what was the bet fit for the group, she presented five concepts to Chalhoub’s board, four in ready-to-wear, one in accessories, with leather goods ultimately selected as the strategic priority.. This, she explained, presented an opportunity to create a product that was high-quality and high-functioning.

Architecture Meets Functionality

Study 01, Makette’s inaugural collection, presents three foundational styles: The Curve, The Patina and The Strata. Each is designed around what Canadas called “systems thinking,” rather than traditional modularity.

“It’s creating a system that you can add things to and that works across multiple times of day and activities.”

The Patina

The large Patina serves as a work tote that fits laptops and daily essentials. The medium Curve transitions from day to night with adjustable straps and detachable chains that can be worn as jewelry. The Strata takes a different approach entirely, comprising multiple pouches in varying sizes that can be worn individually as clutches or combined using chains and straps from other pieces in the collection.

“You can wear just one of them for coffee, or you can play around with combinations,” Canadas said. The design also accommodates tech accessories, with vertical pouch configurations suitable for tablets. A special neckpiece launching with the small leather goods collection will connect multiple Strata pouches, allowing wearers to create their own configurations without needing a traditional handbag base.

“The big one is your go-to work bag. Carry everything, your kids’ stuff, the diaper bag if you need to,” Canadas said. “You get to work and bring the medium one out for meetings or lunch. It’s

[TITLE]Pet Perfume Market to Reach $2.7 billion, Globally, by 2034 at 6.7% CAGR: Allied Market Research:
[TEXT]
The pet perfume market is anticipated to increase due to rise in pet humanization trends, demand for premium grooming products, and the growing popularity of personalized pet care. Expanding urban pet ownership and increased consumer spending on pet hygiene further contribute to consistent sales across specialty stores, online platforms, and grooming service providers.

Market Introduction

Pet perfume is a grooming product formulated to neutralize unpleasant odors and leave a mild, pleasant fragrance on pets. It is designed to enhance cleanliness between baths and contribute to a fresh-smelling coat. Pet perfumes are commonly used by pet owners, groomers, and veterinary professionals as part of routine grooming practices.

Formulated using water-based or alcohol-free solutions, pet perfumes often incorporate natural or synthetic fragrances along with skin-friendly ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, or oatmeal extract. These components help maintain coat hygiene without causing irritation. Beyond masking odors, pet perfume may offer additional benefits like calming effects or flea-repelling properties, depending on the formulation. Safe when used as directed, it supports overall grooming by improving both hygiene and pet-owner interaction.

Market Growth & Opportunities Factors:

The rise in demand for natural and organic pet products has reshaped formulation strategies in the global pet perfume market. Consumers increasingly seek grooming solutions that exclude synthetic fragrances, alcohol, parabens, and sulfate. Manufacturers are responding by using organic floral waters, plant-based essential oils, and non-toxic emulsifiers. Health-conscious consumers and urban households are accelerating the shift toward clean-label and safe pet fragrances, aligning with larger wellness and sustainability trends in the pet care industry. Transparency in ingredients and a focus on skin sensitivity have contributed to stronger market uptake, especially in developed regions.

In addition, organic pet perfumes have gained higher visibility across retail shelves and online platforms due to growing interest in hypoallergenic and eco-conscious options. Branding now highlights cruelty-free claims, biodegradable formulas, and responsibly sourced inputs. Demand in North America and Europe remains strong due to premium pet spending and regulatory support for safe grooming solutions. Brands are increasingly offering alcohol-free and skin-soothing fragrances with clearly labeled compositions, helping consumers identify and trust product safety, further strengthening their presence in the premium segment of the market.

Simultaneously, innovations in long-lasting and multifunctional pet perfumes are influencing buying preferences. Microencapsulation technologies offer extended scent duration, while added functionalities such as antibacterial action or coat detangling improve product value. Spray-on perfumes with dual calming and grooming benefits are gaining traction among time-constrained consumers. Specialty stores and veterinary clinics in markets such as Japan, the U.S., and Germany report higher demand for such solutions. Expansion of organized pet retail formats, featuring in-store testers and post-grooming product demonstrations, has improved trial and repeat purchases.

Major Challenges in Industry & Solutions:

Skin allergies and reactions in pets have created skepticism around pet perfumes, especially among owners of sensitive breeds such as Bulldogs and Persian cats. Concerns over artificial additives, alcohol, and essential oils have led to reports of rashes and inflammation, deterring trial purchases. Limited dermatological testing and lack of regulatory uniformity further undermine consumer confidence and market expansion.

However, pet perfume manufacturers can address allergy concerns by investing in clinical dermatological testing and securing hypoallergenic certifications from recognized veterinary boards. Formulating products with minimal, transparent ingredients and excluding alcohol, parabens, and known irritants can reduce adverse reactions. Marketing products with veterinarian endorsements, breed-specific suitability, and allergy-tested claims helps reassure pet owners. Expanding fragrance-free variants or sensitive skin formulas further attracts cautious consumers while aligning with growing demand for safe grooming options.

In addition, organic pet perfumes, lacking synthetic preservatives, often degrade due to light, temperature, and microbial exposure. This short shelf-life complicates storage and inventory, especially for long supply chains and e-commerce. Consumers experience reduced product performance, such as scent loss or spoilage, which leads to distrust and low repurchase rates. Retailers avoid stocking fragile products, hindering wide distribution and market growth for natural formulations.

To address this restraint, brands can extend shelf-life by using natural preservatives like potassium sorbate, grapefruit seed extract, or fermented radish root filtrate that comply with organic standards. Airless pump packaging, amber glass bottles, and cold-chain logistics improve stability during storage and shipping. Educating retailers and consumers

Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats. Melissa Repko | CNBC

MINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target 's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin. Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in New York's Hudson Valley. With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price. Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers. As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled

[TITLE]SNAP recipients say they're ready to scrimp amid food stamp fight:
[TEXT]
A plan announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide partial food stamp benefits for November during the ongoing government shutdown could offer a measure of relief to millions of Americans. Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.

In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.

However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take "anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months." A spokesperson for the USDA referred CBS News to a social media post from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which also says benefits could take several weeks to arrive.

It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.

"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible," she said.

The White House referred CBS News to the Office of Management and Budget, which also did not respond to a request for comment.

President Trump wrote Tuesday in a Truth Social post that benefits will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified at a press conference later in the day that Mr. Trump was referring to future SNAP payments.

"He does not want to have to keep tapping into an emergency fund and depleting it in the case of a catastrophe in this country," she said.

With questions continuing to swirl around the SNAP program, attention has turned to how this uncertainty directly affects people on food stamps. CBS News spoke with three people

[TITLE]SNAP Benefits Delayed for November 2025:
[TEXT]
Still without a decision on funding legislation, the government shutdown has continued into November, meaning millions of residents will no longer have access to their SNAP Benefits. While federal judges ruled Friday, Oct. 31 that the government must provide funding throughout the shutdown, food aid will be delayed for weeks at a minimum. It could be longer depending on whether the Trump administration accepts or appeals the ruling.

This story appeared in The Logoff, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Subscribe here.

Welcome to The Logoff: After days of uncertainty, the Trump administration will keep food assistance flowing — but only for part of the month.

What’s happening? Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is likely to resume in the near future, after the Trump administration said Monday it would comply with a federal judge’s order to spend about $5.5 billion in contingency funds (essentially, cash the program can draw on to keep operating in emergencies).

SNAP funding lapsed over the weekend as a result of the ongoing government shutdown, interrupting vital food aid for nearly 42 million Americans, many of whom are children. While funding should start flowing again soon, the interruption will hurt SNAP recipients who have to deal with not only lost benefits but also uncertainty about exactly when they will resume.

What’s the context? This interruption in SNAP funding didn’t need to happen. Until early October, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) had a plan on its website outlining the use of contingency funding to keep SNAP benefits flowing. It was subsequently removed from the USDA site and replaced with a message saying, “The well has run dry,” and blaming congressional Democrats.

What’s next for SNAP? The contingency funds the administration is drawing on will only cover about half of November before benefits once again lapse. If the government remains shut by then, benefits are likely to dry up altogether.

That is partially due to the Trump administration’s refusal to explore alternatives to keep SNAP funding flowing past the middle of the month. Last week, a different federal judge in Boston pointed to tariff revenue as an option, but the administration has said they don’t intend to draw on it.

What’s the big picture? As the shutdown drags on, the Trump administration has gone to extraordinary measures to keep funding some of its priorities, such as immigration enforcement and military paychecks. Others, like food assistance, it has to be compelled to fund — and then, only begrudgingly.

And with that, it’s time to log off…

Hi readers, before you go: I thought this NPR story about how communities are coming together to help neighbors who need it as SNAP benefits run dry was touching — even if the surrounding context is grim.

If you want something a little more removed from the news cycle (who can blame you?), this Futurism story about getting the classic video game Doom to run on a European Space Agency satellite might be for you. It’s a delight.

Loss from continuing operations was $4.2 million, or a negative 5.2% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $10.4 million, or a negative 16.8% of revenue, for the third quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations 1 : Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.8 million, or 4.6% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the third quarter last year.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.8 million, or 4.6% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the third quarter last year. Active Buyers and Orders: Active Buyers of 1.57 million and Orders of 1.61 million for the third quarter 2025, representing increases of 26% and 37%, respectively, over the third quarter last year.

Financial Outlook

For the fourth quarter 2025, ThredUp expects:

Revenue in the range of $76.0 million to $78.0 million, +14% year-over-year at the midpoint

Gross margin in the range of 78.0% to 79.0%

Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 3.0%

For the full fiscal year 2025, ThredUp expects:

Revenue in the range of $307.0 million to $309.0 million, +18% year-over-year at the midpoint

Gross margin in the range of 79.0% to 79.2%

Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 4.2%

ThredUp is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance of the Non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA margin to net loss margin, the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP because certain items are out of ThredUp’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude, where applicable in a given period, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, severance and other reorganization costs, and gain on sale of non-marketable equity investment. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue for the same period. Accordingly, a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA in order to calculate forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin is not available without unreasonable effort. However, for the fourth quarter of 2025 and full year 2025, Depreciation and amortization is expected to be $3.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively. In addition, for the fourth quarter of 2025 and full year 2025, Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be $3.8 million and $18.3 million, respectively. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could result in projected net loss being materially greater than is indicated by the currently estimated Adjusted EBITDA margin.

ThredUp is not providing a quantitative reconciliation for free cash flow estimates on a forward-looking basis because it is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to provide a meaningful or reasonably accurate calculation or estimation of net cash provided by operating activities and certain reconciling items on a forward-looking basis, which could be significant to the Company's results.

Puma expects a low double-digit percentage decline in full-year 2025 sales on a currency-adjusted basis, alongside a reported loss in earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT), with capital expenditure planned at around €250m.

In the third quarter (Q3) of 2025, sales fell 10.4% on a currency-adjusted basis to €1.95bn. Currency movements, notably those of the US dollar and the Argentine peso, reduced revenue by €125m, pushing reported sales down 15.3%.

The German sportswear brand’s wholesale revenue dropped 15.4% to €1.38bn. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales rose 4.5% to €570m, driven by a 5.6% increase in e-commerce.

Sales in owned and operated stores were up 3.9%. The DTC share increased to 29.1% from 25.1% in Q3 2024.

In Q3 2025, Puma implemented measures to strengthen its base for 2026 and beyond, cutting lower-quality wholesale business, reducing excess inventory at retail partners, and scaling back promotions in e-commerce and full-price DTC stores.

The reset drove a broad sales decline across all regions. In the Americas, revenue fell 15.2% to €678.1m, with a modest dip in Latin America and the bulk of the decrease stemming from North America.
