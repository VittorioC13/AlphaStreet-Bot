[TITLE]Johnvents, Ondo reaffirm investment in agribusiness, manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Johnvents Group has reaffirmed its commitment to deepening partnerships, investing in capacity, and building industries that will accelerate Nigeria’s economic transformation and boost Africa’s global competitiveness.

The resolve came as the Ondo State Government restated its ambition to position the state as a competitive hub for agribusiness, manufacturing, technology, and energy.

According to a statement, the Johnvents Group’s leadership gave the assurance during the company’s 2025 End-of-Year Celebration held at The Dome, Akure, where industry leaders, international partners, traditional rulers, including the Deji of Akure, and senior government officials gathered to review what the firm described as “a transformative year.”

Delivering the welcome address, Group Executive Director of Johnvents, Tarun Chawla, stated that the organisation had strengthened its operations and expanded its global presence. He noted that the company’s growth was made possible by a supportive business environment provided by the Ondo State Government.

He said, “This year reshaped us as a business. We strengthened our operations, expanded our relevance, and demonstrated what a committed team can achieve when purpose and discipline align. The stability and clarity your administration provides form the foundation on which organisations like ours continue to grow and innovate.”

Chawla appreciated the confidence of partners such as British International Investment, the International Finance Corporation, AFRIEXIM Bank, and other financial institutions in the Group’s long-term vision. He said Johnvents had now become “a global value-chain participant with investments and collaborations spanning Africa, the UAE, Asia, and Europe.”

In his keynote address, the Executive Governor of Ondo State, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, described Johnvents Group as a model of how homegrown enterprises can become global powerhouses without losing touch with their host communities.

Aiyedatiwa noted: “Johnvents stands today as a monument to what focused investment and structured institutional support can achieve. With over ten factories, more than 1,500 direct employees, thousands of benefiting households and an ecosystem of over 5,000 farmers, Johnvents is living proof that prosperity becomes inevitable when ingenuity meets institutional support.”

He listed reforms in ease of doing business, digitisation of government processes, security enhancement, infrastructure expansion, and the work of the Ondo State Development and Investment Promotion Agency as critical pillars of the state’s strategy to strengthen private-sector competitiveness.

The governor noted that the success of companies like Johnvents aligns with the administration’s vision of an inclusive, opportunity-driven economy. “The Johnvents story assures every investor here and across the world that Ondo State is ready for investment, ready for expansion and ready for global competitiveness,” he emphasised.

The event also celebrated the resilience of Johnvents’ workforce and the company’s widening contributions to community development, including education, youth empowerment and agribusiness initiatives.

Johnvents added that it is committed to partnering with local and global institutions, scaling capacity, and building industries that deliver value across Nigeria’s agricultural and manufacturing value chains.

The Group operates seven businesses, including Johnvents Cocoa Factory, Johnvents Trading, Johnvents Foods, Johnvents Industries DMCC, Johnvents Farms, Premium Cocoa Product (Ile-Oluji), and Haven Hauling, spanning production, processing, manufacturing, and trade of commodities and food products in Nigeria and other regions.

Bengaluru | Mumbai: Law firms are ramping up recruitment of capital markets specialists amid a surge in demand stemming from a raft of initial public offerings (IPOs) and other fundraising drives, said industry executives.Demand for lawyers specialising in equity offerings is expected to increase as multinationals prepare to tap the Indian markets, they said.Last month, CMS IndusLaw added a 13-member capital markets team from Saraf and Partners, led by Mathew Thomas. In September, Verist Law hired two partners, Arka Banerjee from Anagram Partners and Nayan Jain from Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, doubling its leadership team.Manan Lahoty, partner and head of capital markets at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas (CAM), said demand will remain elevated as younger investors favour liquid financial assets over traditional stores of wealth such as gold and real estate. He added that successful listings of Hyundai Motor India and LG Electronics had encouraged other global groups to consider listing their local operations. "India offers long-term stability and genuine growth, and that is feeding directly into capital markets activity," he said.Lahoty joined CAM last year with eight partners and

Transportation Secretary Duffy Launches “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” Campaign, Announces $1B in Funding to Support Initiative

Posted on by Miami Rebel

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy today launched his “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” campaign ahead of a busy holiday travel season. The goal of the campaign is to address a common refrain from the public – it can be challenging to travel as a family. From needing more dedicated spaces for young children and exercise equipment, to finding places for mothers to nurse their children, to staying fit on the go, or struggling to find more healthy food options, the Trump Administration is committed to making every stage of the travel journey more seamless.

To improve families’ experiences in airport terminals, Secretary Duffy announced $1 billion in funding to incentivize more family-friendly resources in airport terminals. This can include:

Creating more children’s play areas or exercise areas Adding mothers’ rooms or nursing pods Reconfiguring security checkpoints to create family screening lanes Building sensory rooms for children with special needs Other creative terminal projects that focus on enhancing the family travel journey As part of the campaign launch, Secretary Duffy was joined by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Paul Saladino, a double board-certified Physician Nutrition Specialist, Isabel Brown, a content creator and young mom, and Luke Saunders, the CEO and Founder of Farmer’s Fridge.

In addition to the federal funding USDOT is providing to enhance physical infrastructure, the group also emphasized the administration’s interest in collaborating with airports and private sector partners to improve access to nutritional food options.

[TITLE]Kawa Capital Provides $79M Construction Loan for Boston-Area Life Sciences Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, a Boston-area developer specializing in transportation projects, has secured $79.3 million to build The Bolt, a 180,000-square-foot life sciences lab, office and manufacturing complex in Woburn, Mass., a suburb 10 miles outside Boston.

Kawa Capital Management provided the construction financing for a project that is expected to require a total of $125 million of investment capital. Aries Capital served as the capital markets advisor on the transaction.

Jeremy Lash, director at Kawa Capital Management, described The Bolt in a statement as a “high-quality asset” in a popular market near Boston.

“We are confident The Bolt will draw interest from energy, manufacturing, life sciences and technology companies looking for prime space in an optimal location,” he said.

Located at 216 New Boston Street in Woburn — which has become a minor hub for life sciences development in recent years — The Bolt is part of a larger $400 million investment project by Cabot, Cabot & Forbes.

These other projects include the development of Emblem 120, a 289-unit luxury multifamily complex with ground-floor retail, and Zero New Boston, a planned building that would bring 250 apartments and 1,200 square feet of retail to Woburn.

In a statement, Daniel Nagler, chief investment officer at Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, called Woburn “an ideal location,” noting that the suburb is accessible from both Boston and Cambridge via two highways and a commuter rail station, positioning it as a regional destination for life sciences and other CRE development.

“We believe it will continue to attract innovative companies, and it is why we are so bullish on the location,” Nagler added.

The Bolt is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2027.

[TITLE]Elon Musk's SpaceX Moves Bitcoin Ahead of Potential Record IPO:
[TEXT]
In brief SpaceX move around $94 million worth of Bitcoin on Wednesday.

The move is the latest in a string of similarly sized transfers as the firm reportedly prepares for a potentially record-breaking IPO.

Elon Musk's company holds about $765 million worth of Bitcoin.

Privately held aerospace company SpaceX moved more than $94 million in Bitcoin on Wednesday, according to on-chain data, ahead of reported plans to go public in 2026.

Bitcoin addresses labeled as belonging to SpaceX by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence transferred around 1,021 BTC in total to two addresses, broken into amounts of 407 BTC and 614 BTC.

“SpaceX just transferred $94 million of BTC. They have been moving around $100 million of BTC every week for around the past two months now,” Arkham posted on X.

﻿

The move is the latest in a string of transfers from Elon Musk’s firm this year as it reportedly prepares for a potential record-breaking IPO. The public listing process could see the company raise more than $30 billion at a $1.5 trillion valuation, according to a report from Bloomberg.

At this time, it is not immediately clear if the recent transfers, or any from previously this year, have anything to do with a potential IPO. A representative for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

While regular transfers started to occur earlier this year, prior to those transactions, SpaceX hadn’t touched its Bitcoin holdings in three years. Most recently, it transferred around $100 million in BTC last week.

The Starbase, Texas-based firm once held as much as 25,000 BTC in 2022, but its holdings have shrunk over the years.

As of Wednesday, the firm holds 8,285 BTC valued around $770 million, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net—good enough to make it the fourth-largest private company holding the asset. That mark would make it the 14th largest holder if it maintains its position when it becomes a public company.

Bitcoin has rebounded from a slide which sent it to nearly $81,000 in November. The top crypto asset by market cap recently changed hands around $92,287. However, it still remains nearly 27% off its October all-time high above $126,000.

[TITLE]Billionaires Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk racing to build AI data centers in space: report:
[TEXT]
Jeff Bezos’ aerospace firm Blue Origin has been working for over a year on the necessary technology for artificial intelligence data centers in space, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Meanwhile, Musk’s SpaceX plans to use an upgraded version of its Starlink satellites to host AI computing payloads, pitching the technology as part of a share sale that could value the company at $800 billion, the report said, citing people involved in the discussions.

SpaceX and Blue Origin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report independently.

The concept of orbital data centers has gained traction among tech giants as those on Earth have driven up demand for electricity and water to cool their servers.

Amazon founder Bezos in October predicted that gigawatt-scale data centers would be built in space within the next 10 to 20 years and that continuously available solar energy meant they would eventually outperform those based on Earth.

“We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centers in space in the next couple of decades,” Bezos said at the time. “These giant training clusters … will be better built in space, because we have solar power there, 24/7. There are no clouds and no rain, no weather.”

Last week, Musk had dismissed media reports that SpaceX was raising funds at an $800 billion valuation, calling them inaccurate.

SpaceX is looking to raise more than $25 billion through an initial public offering in 2026, a move that could boost the rocket-maker’s valuation to over $1 trillion, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
