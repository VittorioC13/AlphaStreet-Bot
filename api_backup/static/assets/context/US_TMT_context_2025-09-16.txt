[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: The Nasdaq Composite was the overachieving sibling last week:
[TEXT]
The Nasdaq Composite was an overachiever last week. After ending Friday higher — outperforming the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average , both of which closed in the red — the tech-heavy index officially had five straight days of all-time closing highs.

On a weekly basis, the Nasdaq Composite, with its 2% advance, also pulled ahead of the S&P 500's 1.6% increase and the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1% rise.

Given the Nasdaq Composite's moniker as the "tech-heavy index" (much favored by financial writers who have to come up with many ways to describe it), there's little surprise in saying that technology companies were the main engine for its finish at the top of the podium.

But it's not just any tech. OpenAI seemed to be behind much of the market's rise, suggesting the artificial intelligence narrative is still compelling to investors. Shares of Oracle soared last week largely because of a deal it had made with the artificial intelligence firm; companies associated with it, such as Broadcom and Nvidia , have also had their share prices lifted previously.

With a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve all but certain to come this week — which would especially benefit cash-burning, debt-ridden, yet-to-be-profitable tech startups like OpenAI — the youngest of the three major U.S. indexes might continue to outshine its siblings in the near term.

[TITLE]Housing market: the 'most critical' variable for predicting recessions is at lowest since pandemic:
[TEXT]
The housing market is long been seen as an early warning sign for recessions, and one data point in particular has caught the attention of Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.

In social media posts on Sunday, he noted that Moody’s own leading economic indicator that uses machine learning has estimated the odds of a recession in the next 12 months are now at 48%.

Even though it’s less than 50%, Zandi pointed out that the probability has never been that high previously without the economy eventually slipping into a downturn.

A crucial component in the Moody’s indicator comes from the housing market.

“The algorithm has identified building permits as the most critical economic variable for predicting recessions. And while permits had been holding up reasonably well, as builders supported sales through interest rate buydowns and other incentives, inventories of unsold homes are now high and on the rise,” Zandi warned.

“In response, builders are pulling back, and permits have started to slump. They are now as low as they’ve been since the pandemic shutdowns.”

Last month, the Census Bureau reported that residential building permits in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million, down 2.8% from the prior month and down 5.7% from a year ago.

In July, Zandi singled out the housing market for concern, escalating it to a “red flare” as home sales, homebuilding, and house prices were getting squeezed by elevated mortgage rates.

While the 30-year fixed rate has since come down from near 7% to
