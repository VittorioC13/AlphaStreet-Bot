[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

[TITLE]MeitY clears Rs 5,500 crore electronic parts manufacturing investment:
[TEXT]
The Centre on Monday approved Rs 5,532 crore of investments from several companies, including Kaynes Circuits India and SRF, under the electronic component manufacturing scheme (ECMS).Among the other companies getting the federal nod include Syrma Strategic Electronics and Ascent Circuits.The companies selected in the first tranche of ECMS have committed to cumulatively produce Rs 36,559 crore of electronic components, including multi layer printed circuit boards, copper clad laminates (CCLs), optical transceivers and other electronic components, from seven projects.The approved units are spread across Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and will create over 5,100 direct jobs. Products from these units will establish trusted supply chains for the defence, telecom, electric vehicles, and renewable energy sectors.In a key development, the new electronics manufacturing units will meet the 100% of the domestic demand for CCLs, electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said. Providing the insulating substrate and conductive copper layers, these form the basic structure for electronic circuits. Mostly imported from China, its price is now rising by 8-9% every alternate month, ET reported last month."Once we add the design input that is going into domestic value addition, combined with all the plants planned under ECMS, domestic value addition will go to about 40% over the next few years," Vaishnaw said.Upto 20% of the demand for printed circuit boards (PCB) and 15% of the demand for camera modules will also be met from the upcoming units, Vaishnaw said. Overall, 60% of the production from the approved projects is set to be exported, he added.Kaynes Circuits India Pvt Ltd, the wholly owned subsidiary of Mysuru-based Kaynes Technology Ltd has committed the highest investment, at Rs 3,280 crore for four projects. Kaynes will set up a factory in Chennai, construction for which is set to finish by March, 2026, Ramesh Kannan, Executive Vice Chairman of Kaynes Technology India Ltd said. "We will be producing multi-layered and HDI-PCBs, as well as camera modules at this unit. Copper laminates are about 24 months away, but we have lined up the partnership to set up a unit for it in Tuticorin," he said.Syrma Strategic Electronics Pvt Ltd, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Mumbai-based Syrma SGS Technology Limited will invest Rs 765 crore to produce multi layer PCBs. The investment is based in Syrma's upcoming factory in Andhra Pradesh, the groundbreaking of which will take place next month, Jasbir Singh Gujral, Managing Director of Syrma SGS said.A Rs 991 crore investment proposal by Amber group-subsidiary Ascent Circuits Pvt Ltd to manufacture PCBs in Tamil Nadu, and a Rs 496 crore proposal by SRF Limited to manufacture polypropylene film, used to produce capacitors, in Madhya Pradesh, make up the first batch of ECMS approvals.Officials said other winning applications will be announced in multiple batches going forward. "It's an ongoing process. The applications are being cleared expeditiously, based on the demand-supply dynamics in the global economy for the components in question," a MeitY official said.The Centre received 249 applications with proposed investments surpassing Rs 1,15,351 crore under ECMS, buoyed by interest from smaller manufacturers, the MeitY had announced in early-October, two days after the application deadline for ECMS closed on September 30. The response was nearly double the targeted Rs 59,350 crore under the scheme. Approved with an outlay of Rs 22,919 crore, the scheme is set to yield electronics components of about Rs 10,34,700 Crores in the next six years, 2.2-times the targeted Rs 4,56,000 crore worth of production.

[TITLE]Transportation awards Google major contract after ‘OneGov’ deal:
[TEXT]
The Department of Transportation has inked a deal for Google’s Workspace software suite using discounted rates made possible through the company’s April ‘OneGov’ agreement with the General Services Administration.

According to contracting documents obtained by Nextgov/FCW, Transportation awarded the five-year enterprise license agreement on Sept. 27 to deliver Google Workspace across the department via prime contractor Carahsoft.

The contract has a total ceiling value of up to $89 million and will ultimately provide the department — which has more than 50,000 employees across the country — access to Google Workspace’s cloud-native apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Meet and more, as well as popular AI tools Gemini and NotebookLM.

Google declined to comment for this story and the Transportation Department was unable to comment due to the government shutdown.

In early April, Google became the first company to negotiate an agreement with GSA through its OneGov strategy, which essentially treats government customers as a single large purchaser. Google offered a temporary 71% discount on Workspace through Sept. 30 for government customers, a discount Transportation took advantage of in this deal. More than a dozen tech companies followed Google’s lead in negotiating OneGov deals and discounting billions of dollars’ worth of software to government customers, many for a limited period of time.

“We’re excited to see agencies using the OneGov offerings to help deliver on their missions while also saving taxpayer dollars,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said in a statement to Nextgov/FCW. “This outcome shows how diversity in the federal marketplace yields efficiency, prioritizing American taxpayers first.”

Transportation’s Workspace deal could be a harbinger of more widespread government adoption for Google, which launched its Google Public Sector division more than three years ago specifically to target government business.

While the Google Workspace suite is used by several large agencies, including GSA, the Energy Department and Air Force Research Laboratory, Microsoft’s 365 suite has been the dominant productivity and communications software across the federal government for more than a decade. Contracting documents indicate Transportation and its component agencies, like the Federal Aviation Administration, have long used Microsoft 365 for collaboration and communication needs. It’s unclear how this new deal with Google will impact its Microsoft relationship.

In a late June interview with Nextgov/FCW, Transportation Chief Information Officer Pavan Pidugu laid out his vision for the department's IT operations, focusing on process improvements, people and products. Pidugu said he wanted to remove shadow IT across the department, get rid of redundant IT systems, speed up acquisitions and shift the department and its it staff toward becoming a product-focused organization.

Karoline Leavitt Calls Indian Trucker Illegal Alien After Deadly California Road Accident Kill Three

US transportation secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he is about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver's licenses to non-citizens.In an appearance on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," Duffy said governor Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with department of transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued. His statement came after investigations into two recent fatal crashes involving Sikh drivers showed widespread malpractice in issuance of commercial driving licences (CDLs)."So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California," Duffy said. "And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses."Eva Spiegel, a spokesperson for California's department of motor vehicles, said the Trump administration "has no legitimate basis" to withhold federal highway transportation funds. "The federal govt previously allowed commercial driver's licences for asylum seekers and refugees and on Sept 26 announced emergency regulations to cease this practice that went into effect on Sept 29.California is in compliance with these regulations and will remain in compliance with federal law. "When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and that of Texas, which is the only state with more licenced commercial drivers.Duffy said California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licences to non-citizens. Duffy said earlier he would withhold $40 million from California as it is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. agencies

Draper awarded $25 million in state and local funding for Lowell IMPACT Center construction

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Oct 28, 2025

Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey has announced up to $25 million in state and local funding in partnership with the City of Lowell to support the construction of Draper's Integrated Microelectronics Production and Advanced Chip Technology (IMPACT) Center. This initiative is part of the state's strategy to expand support for the defense sector in Massachusetts.

The planned 75,000 square foot IMPACT Center will be located in the Lowell Innovation Network Corridor (LINC) and is set to house advanced facilities for microelectronics design, production, and packaging. Draper will deliver technology from these facilities to its U.S. Military, Aerospace, and Government customers. The center is expected to create over 150 new jobs in national security, including technicians, engineers, and executive roles.

Governor Healey said, "Massachusetts is proud of our defense leadership - we are the birthplace of the National Guard, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, and we've carried that legacy of innovation and service forward for generations. We are proud to support Draper's efforts to strengthen this leadership by establishing the IMPACT Center, which will create good jobs, grow our economy and bolster our national security in partnership with UMass Lowell and the City of Lowell."

Jerry Wohletz, Ph.D., President and CEO of Draper, stated, "Today's investment reflects Governor Healey's ongoing commitment to the needs of the nation's defense sector. The IMPACT Center will significantly expand the nation's secure, on-shore microelectronics production capacity and deliver new capabilities to our military. The facility will also strengthen the Commonwealth's manufacturing base and create new jobs for a highly skilled workforce, educated and trained in our local universities, colleges, and trade schools. We are grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration, the Commonwealth, and our partners in state and federal government for supporting our vision of what can be accomplished by this investment."

Draper's partnership involves collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML), the University of Massachusetts Building Authority, the City of Lowell, and the Commonwealth. Draper intends to provide up to $10 million over the next decade for programming, research, and education at UML.

Earlier this year, Draper opened a corporate campus at UML as the anchor tenant in LINC, a 1.2 million square foot development designed to foster an innovation ecosystem and economic growth for Lowell. LINC was made possible through a joint effort of UML, UMBA, the City of Lowell, and significant support from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

[TITLE]Major Vietnamese investment announced to boost British aerospace sector:
[TEXT]
Vietnamese airline Vietjet announces investment into 100 new aircraft, with wings designed in Bristol and made in North Wales

major deals for Airbus and Rolls-Royce to benefit sites in Bristol, Derby and North Wales, supporting thousands of jobs and boosting the economy to deliver the Plan for Change

Transport Secretary visits Airbus in Bristol to see research and development in action, with investment supporting aerospace innovation to ensure UK remains a global leader

A significant investment into the British aerospace sector has been announced today (30 October 2025), following a major deal being made between a Vietnamese airline and the UK aerospace sector.

Following the Prime Minister’s meeting with Vietnam’s General Secretary yesterday, VietJet has announced a significant order for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft.

The Transport Secretary visited Airbus’s site in Bristol today to mark the order and see how this will allow Airbus to continue investing in research and development.

Overall, the deal supports Airbus’ 79,000 strong supply chain and 12,000 employees across the country, with Airbus estimated to bring £5.3 billion to the economy each year.

The wings for 100 aircraft will be manufactured at Airbus’ Broughton site in North Wales, with their design developed at the company’s Filton facility, showing a strong pipeline from concept to reality delivered from the UK . This programme will safeguard highly skilled jobs across both regions, supporting delivery of the Plan for Change.

The deal comes alongside further investment from Vietjet into the UK aviation sector, with Vietjet and Rolls-Royce signing a deal for 92 Trent 7000 engines to be manufactured in the UK for use in 40 A330 Neos, also set to support thousands of high-skilled jobs.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

This landmark deal shows that British innovation continues to be at the forefront in connecting the world. By working hand-in-hand with our international partners, we are helping our aerospace sector soar, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs, boosting our economy and delivering real benefits for working people across the UK as part of our Plan for Change.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said:

This major investment from VietJet is a big vote of confidence in British aerospace and engineering, and will support jobs across the country to deliver our Plan for Change. Homegrown research and development is vital to our net zero ambitions and I’m delighted that this order will encourage investment back into aviation innovation – helping us to continue as a global leader in the industry.

Transport Secretary visits Airbus site in Bristol

The government is also supporting sectors such as aviation with major investments to encourage innovation, including £20.4 billion for research and development across the UK until April 2026.

Further funding to support aviation innovation was also announced over the summer, with £63 million to encourage the development of sustainable aviation fuels ( SAF ) and £4 million allocated to grassroots research projects trialling next-generation drone technology.

These investments have been echoed by strong industry support, with energy logistics firm Exolum recently announcing the creation of a brand-new SAF supply network, starting with a fuel blending facility in Portishead, just outside Bristol.

The government is supporting airport expansion at Gatwick and Luton – where capacity upgrades have been approved – and Heathrow. The moves support the government’s growth mission and any expansion will be balanced with environmental, climate and air quality aims.

By encouraging investment that feeds back into innovation, such as VietJet’s order, aviation can take advantage of cleaner, greener technology to reduce its carbon footprint and expand airports responsibly.

Australian company Hypersonix secures major defence and aerospace investment for green hydrogen hypersonic flight

by Simon Mansfield

Sydney, Australia (SPX) Oct 28, 2025

Hypersonix Launch Systems, based in Brisbane, recently completed a $46 million Series A funding round led by High Tor Capital of the UK, with support from Saab and RKKVC, as well as participation by the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) and Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC). The investment will accelerate the development of reusable hydrogen-powered hypersonic aircraft designed for defence and aerospace missions. Hypersonix employs 45 specialists in engineering, manufacturing, and testing.

The Series A round marks NRFC's first investment in the defence sector and aims to strengthen domestic capability in hypersonic and counter-hypersonic technologies for Australia and allied nations. QIC Ventures described the company's technology as a significant advancement for allies requiring faster, more frequent flight capability through hydrogen propulsion.

Founded in 2019, Hypersonix develops flight systems powered by green hydrogen. Its SPARTAN scramjet engine, which reaches Mach 12 and has no moving parts, was invented by co-founder Dr Michael Smart. Unlike kerosene-fuelled engines, SPARTAN eliminates CO2 emissions and reduces maintenance by relying on hydrogen fuel. Dr Smart emphasized the importance of building clean and reusable aerospace platforms with applications in real operational environments, while co-founder David Waterhouse stated the capital raise marks a pivotal moment for Australian aerospace development.

CEO Matt Hill highlighted that this funding supports both national and allied defence priorities and enables Hypersonix to launch the world's first hydrogen-powered hypersonic aircraft. Chairman Arthur Sinodinos, former US Ambassador and Australian Minister, said the investment demonstrates support for local leadership in next-generation aerospace and sovereign industrial capability.

Proceeds from the round will fund a NASA-backed test flight of the DART AE vehicle, powered by SPARTAN, with operations under the US Department of Defense HyCAT program via the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). Hypersonix was selected as the first contract for HyCAT from a pool of more than 60 companies. The project aims to demonstrate the world's first sustained hypersonic flight using green hydrogen.

Additional funds will build advanced manufacturing facilities in Queensland and advance development of VISR, an 8-metre-long, reusable hydrogen-fuelled aircraft equipped with four SPARTAN engines and ceramic matrix composites for sustained hypersonic flight, supporting intelligence, surveillance, rapid delivery, and space system testing.
