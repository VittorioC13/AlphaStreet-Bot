[TITLE]China and Iran Seal Oil-for-Infrastructure Deal to Bypass U.S. Sanctions:
[TEXT]
China has formalized a barter-style framework with Iran in which crude oil is exchanged for infrastructure projects (from rail lines and ports to industrial works) rather than cash. The volumes involved are substantial: Beijing already imports an estimated 1.4 to 1.6 million barrels per day of Iranian crude, much of it under disguised labels. The new structure secures long-term supply while insulating both sides from dollar clearing and direct sanctions exposure. This arrangement does not fall outside U.S. sanctions law. It remains a purchase of Iranian crude under Executive Order 13846, regardless of how payment is made. Whether settled in goods, services, or construction contracts, it qualifies as a “significant transaction” for Iranian petroleum, leaving traders, contractors, and shipping firms exposed to secondary sanctions. Chinese contractors can take crude as compensation for project work, while settlement occurs through non-dollar channels or deferred credits. The oil moves through opaque intermediaries and reflagged tankers before reaching Chinese ports. The infrastructure offset simply adds another layer of deniability, keeping large state banks and insurers insulated from direct exposure. Washington has not shut this one down for practical reasons.

Politics, Geopolitics & Conflict

China has formalized a barter-style framework with Iran in which crude oil is exchanged for infrastructure projects (from rail lines and ports to industrial works) rather than cash. The volumes involved are substantial: Beijing already imports an estimated 1.4 to 1.6 million barrels per day of Iranian crude, much of it under disguised labels. The new structure secures long-term supply while insulating both sides from dollar clearing and direct sanctions exposure. This arrangement does not fall outside U.S. sanctions law. It remains a purchase of Iranian crude under Executive Order 13846, regardless of how payment is made. Whether settled in goods, services, or construction contracts, it qualifies as a “significant transaction” for Iranian petroleum, leaving traders, contractors, and shipping firms exposed to secondary sanctions. Chinese contractors can take crude as compensation for project work, while settlement occurs through non-dollar channels or deferred credits. The oil moves through opaque intermediaries and reflagged tankers before reaching Chinese ports. The infrastructure offset simply adds another layer of deniability, keeping large state banks and insurers insulated from direct exposure. Washington has not shut this one down for practical reasons. Enforcement would require targeting dozens of Chinese intermediaries, logistics providers, and financial conduits that also serve legitimate trade. Doing so would risk disrupting China’s broader supply networks and provoke retaliation across unrelated sectors. U.S. policymakers appear to tolerate limited Iranian oil flows to China as a pressure valve, stabilizing Tehran’s finances just enough to prevent collapse, but not enough to embolden it regionally.

Russia’s move to revoke its 2010 plutonium disposal accord with Washington is more political signaling than substantive escalation. The agreement was meant to eliminate 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium per side, but it has already been suspended since 2016, when Moscow accused the U.S. of failing to fulfill its part after changing the disposal method. What’s new is the formal withdrawal process, which adds drama to the timing. It comes days after fresh U.S. sanctions and amid Trump’s renewed hard line on nuclear rearmament. The Kremlin wants to underline that any arms-control architecture surviving from the Obama era is now defunct and that nuclear leverage, not dialogue, defines parity. In practical terms, the plutonium stockpiles are already outside active use and under IAEA observation, so no material risk shift occurs. But symbolically, it reinforces that Moscow is preparing for a post-New START landscape where nuclear signaling again becomes a bargaining tool, not a stabilizer.

Russia launched one of its largest combined missile and drone barrages in months overnight, striking residential areas and several power generation sites across central and western Ukraine, including in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Kyiv said more than 80 incoming targets were detected, of which roughly two-thirds were intercepted. The attacks appear aimed at stressing Ukraine’s power grid ahead of winter, echoing last year’s campaign that left millions without heat or light for weeks. Independent analysis this week from The Moscow Times questioned claims that Ukrainian strikes have destroyed 38% of Russia’s oil refining capacity, suggesting that while dozens of refineries have been hit since early 2024, only a fraction remain offline for extended periods. Many plants sustained limited damage, with Russia restoring throughput faster than initially assumed, often within days or weeks. The cumulative impact, though real, is far smaller than Kyiv’s portrayal and has not significantly altered Russian fuel export volumes or internal supply so far. The deeper concern for Moscow is the geographic spread of these attacks, which show Kyiv’s drones can now reach nearly any refining region in European Russia, including the Volga basin and Leningrad oblast.

Washington has sanctioned several Indian firms and executives tied to Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade. The U.S. Treasury said the companies shipped Iranian origin products through intermediaries in the Gulf and East Asia, masking cargoes as regional blends. Indian refiners officially halted direct Iranian imports years ago, but secondary trading and blending networks have continued.

Staying on the sanctions beat, it’s been a busy week. Washington has sanctioned more than 50 people, entities, and vessels accused of helping move Iranian oil and liquefied petroleum gas. The new designations include nearly two dozen shipping vessels, a China-based crude terminal, and a smaller independent refinery accused of handling hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian LPG through disguised intermediaries. This hits not only Iranian front companies but also parts of the Chinese gray market that have been quietly absorbing sanctioned cargoes for reprocessing and reexport.

[TITLE]Power sector opening up for new players: DG AIDA:
[TEXT]
Opening of the power distribution sector to more than one player in an area, if accepted, may take India’s electricity sector to a more competitive region. “You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up for private,” said former Power Secretary Alok Kumar, who is currently the Director General of All India Discoms Association (AIDA). In the draft amendment proposal to the Electricity Act, recently put out by the government for stakeholders’ comments, there is a move to have multiple players operating in the same area, and the player can be from private sector, too. Kumar shares the challenges that exist and the way forward. Edited excerpts:

The government has released draft amendments to the Electricity Act that propose opening up electricity distribution to private companies and refined regulatory mechanism. How different is it from the existing regulations and norms?

You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up the segment for new players. In privatisation, it is at the discretion of the present owner — the State government — whenever they want to rope in private sector into the business. What the draft Bill is attempting, in my understanding, is that it is allowing more than one player to operate in an area, and it can be a private player or a government company. The law itself provides for what we normally call a parallel licence, or second or subsequent licence.

In Section 14 of the Act, it provides that any person who fulfils the conditions laid down by the government can apply to the Regulatory Commission for a second or a new licence in the same area in which there is already a licence. Earlier, the new entrant was mandated to build their own distribution network. But now it will not be mandated under the proposed draft. The entrant can use the network of the existing licensee. As regards the proposed electricity authority, in simple terms, it will work to build consensus on reforms on the lines of the GST Council.

Recently, the apex court ordered clear-cut guidelines on the creation and amortisation of regulatory assets. It has mandated the clearance of accumulated regulatory assets (past dues) within four years, with new assets to be liquidated within three years. What is your take on this?

Rules and Tariff Policy already provide for this. The Court has ordered time-bound compliance. If this is followed, it will make tariffs cost reflective. The tariff policy made an exception in some cases — in case there is a natural calamity or something else, it is not possible to immediately raise the tariffs. You can create a regulatory asset, but it has to be very expeditiously liquidated. However, there are State regulators who have not liquidated these regulatory assets for very long. We must acknowledge that non-compliance increases interest cost on consumers, and the subsequent political regime will never like to raise tariff to clear past regulatory assets.

The Supreme Court has only affirmed the situation, and has directed the regulatory commissions to follow the law. It is a very good development. I know some have gone to the Supreme Court, asking for some time. Meanwhile, Rajasthan has already taken a step forward to liquidate regulatory assets.

Is capacity-swapping a doable solution for bettering continued availability? How does it work for discom health?

Traditionally, in our Power Purchase Agreements, three aspects were bundled — you buy capacity, you also buy your right on energy, and you also buy ancillary services required. But now, the penetration of renewable energy is creating mismatch in demand and supply. So, in that context, you must have sufficient capacity to meet the demand in any scenario — more than expected demand or less than expected generation. So, that available capacity can be swapped as per the need of the players. Energy can be purchased from such capacity through markets. There is a urgent requirement to have a separate capacity market framework, and the utilities must be bound to enter into contracts for adequate capacity. This will minimise stranded fixed costs.

Is the grid ready to take the energy mix. What is your take on it?

We have robust grid and reached a stage where General Network means once you are connected, you can sell your electricity anywhere in India. However, now the energy mix is changing because of the increased penetration of variable generation sources. So, we need more flexible resources like battery storage or pump storage capacity to take care of variations in demand and supply. In addition, we need digitisation to make the grid work because we need a lot of data in near real time or for operations and for future forecasts.

Is there a mechanism to work on a comfortable tariff that is suitable to all stakeholders?

The word comfortable is not appropriate. What we should aim at is a tariff based on efficient costs. Efficient cost of generation, efficient cost of transmission, efficient cost of distribution. So, if these activities are taken efficiently, whatever is the cost, that has to be reflected into the tariff. There is no other way to sustain this power sector. For example, if you keep on adding generation plants, it is not efficient cost. Some of the very peak demand can be met through demand response at a much lesser cost using digital technologies and efficient market.

So, tariffs should be based on efficiency in generation, transmission and distribution, and in markets. Whatever is the efficient cost, it should be passed through tariff. More importantly, the tariff is an outcome of a process of allocation of cost to different consumers. There is a pool of cost which you have incurred. Allocation happens in two stages. First, the determination of the demand charges and energy charges. And then you give some cross subsidies to the different consumer categories. So, my take is the allocation of cost should be very fair and transparent.

To make tariff comfortable, the State government already have a discretion by giving subsidy the needy consumers.

[TITLE]Jio Payments Bank wins contract for MLFF project at 2 toll plazas on Gurugram-Jaipur highway:
[TEXT]
Jio Financial Services on Monday said its subsidiary Jio Payments Bank has secured a contract to implement the FASTag Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)-based MLFF collection system at two toll plazas between Gurugram and Jaipur.

With this, Jio Payments Bank Ltd (JPBL) has forayed into next-generation tolling services for Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) road projects, which is an electronic toll collection system that eliminates physical toll booths and allows vehicles to pay tolls without slowing down or stopping.

In a regulatory filing, Jio Financial Services said the two toll plazas -- Shahjahanpur and Manoharpura, between Gurugram and Jaipur were awarded as part of the tender issued by Indian Highways Management Company Ltd (IHMCL) for managing toll processing under India's pilot MLFF project.

So far, five MLFF bids have been awarded, of which JPBL has secured two, demonstrating its competitiveness in this space.

Securing the contract to collect and process tolls for an MLFF project is a significant milestone for JPBL, building on the foundation of its FASTag acquisition-based toll processing operations, which commenced in July 2025, Jio Fin said.

JPBL is currently managing toll operations at 11 toll plazas on different highway stretches as an acquirer bank. With the acquisition of toll management rights at these two MLFF road projects, JPBL is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in the country's evolving infrastructure-linked digital payments landscape, it added.

Jio Payments Bank Managing Director & CEO Vinod Easwaran said, "Our expansion into the tolling ecosystem is a natural progression of our mission to digitise everyday payments and build smart financial infrastructure at scale.

"By leveraging the synergy of digital capabilities with the group ecosystem, we are actively building capabilities to participate in the evolving mobility ecosystem in India," Easwaran said.

[TITLE]‘No trade-off’ between sustainability and growth, India can grow by 7.5-8%: Nicholas Stern:
[TEXT]
There is no trade-off between economic growth and moving to renewable sources of energy and India can even increase its GDP growth rate to 7.5-8 per cent from 6.5 per cent currently by aggressively investing in its green transition, according to NICHOLAS STERN, the IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government at the London School of Economics.

“…you still get that residual argument that somehow a developing nation will have to choose between sustainability and climate on the one hand and growth in incomes on the other. That’s absolutely wrong…and it’s very important we are very clear that there is no trade-off,” he said in an interview with The Indian Express. Stern also said the path India takes to becoming a developed economy by 2047 will be crucial for the world and that it needs to increase its investment-to-GDP ratio by 5 percentage points, remove impediments to investment, get the incentives right to invest in modern technologies – particularly green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Edited excerpts:

US President Donald Trump’s focus has been on tariff policies. But he is also undoing years of progress made in the renewables sector. Is that more dangerous than the chaos the trade disruptions are causing?

Trump has been disruptive in a number of directions. One, of course, is the tariffs and the structure of world trade. Another is health, where he’s taking the US away from the World Health Organization (WHO) and attacking vaccinations. On security, he is backing off from the defence of Europe. Aid has been dismantled.

Story continues below this ad

One important way forward for the rest of the world is to stay united on these issues. If the US is undermining WTO, which it is, then try to find trade agreements between nations which look quite similar. I think it would be very good if the EU trade agreement (with India) – which I think is coming – looks like the one with the UK. I hope there’ll be more trade agreements with Asia. The more they look similar, the more we’re sustaining the idea that trade should be symmetric and with minimal barriers because we all benefit from that.

In many ways, climate is similar (to health and trade) – we have the international fora where we can find agreements and carry on. At the same time, the cost of solar and batteries has fallen dramatically. If we compare with 1975, it’s not that it has fallen by a factor of 100 – it’s fallen by a factor close to 1,000, which is extraordinary. It is unambiguously the cheapest form of electricity generation.

On the climate side, the forces of change are strong. But we are going nowhere near fast enough. We are probably heading, given current policies, to something like 2.5-3°C (rise in temperatures); we’re already at

Mars has signed its first renewable energy acceleration contract in Europe in partnership with GoldenPeaks Capital, as it looks to reinforce its commitment to renewable electricity.

According to the multinational confectionary company, it has partnered with the European renewable energy developer to launch more than 100 new solar projects in Poland.

The new project is set to come online in 2027 and will provide more than 129 megawatts of clean energy to Mars and produce approximately 222 gigawatt hours annually, which Mars claims is enough to power approximately 100,000 households each year.

The collaboration builds on the existing renewable energy commitments from the two companies.

In Mars’ latest 2024 sustainability report, the company said it delivered a 16.4% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2015, while 58% of the electricity it sourced is renewable.

Mars aims to reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.

[TITLE]Digital Utilities Ventures Completes Acquisition and Name Change:
[TEXT]
MANKATO, Minn., Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. (OTC: DUTV), operating as Easy Environmental Solutions, has received notice that the processing of its corporate action by FINRA has been completed. As a result, the Company finalizes its acquisition of Lifestyle Dock Company, LLC, its name will be changed, its reverse stock split will be completed and in 20 days its trading symbol will be changed to EZES. This represents another significant milestone in the Company’s transformation into a leading developer of modular technologies that solve major world problems.

Now, the Company will officially complete its name change to Easy Environmental Solutions, Inc., a name that reflects its expanding focus on sustainable technologies. The Company is expected to begin trading under its new ticker symbol, EZES, at the opening of trading on October 30, 2025. The Company plans to apply to uplist to the OTCQB Venture Market following the completion of an audit, currently underway, and the Company’s previously announced reverse stock split, a procedural step designed to align with OTCQB eligibility requirements and strengthen the Company’s overall capital markets profile.

The acquisition of Lifestyle Dock Company is also now finalized following the completion of FINRA’s process. Lifestyle is a premium manufacturer of luxury docks with a strong distribution network and East Coast manufacturing facility. The acquisition expands Easy Environmental Solutions’ product portfolio, adds a strategically located production base, and creates new opportunities to integrate its patented NanoVoid™ clean-water technology directly into high-end docks and marina systems. Lifestyle’s revenues will be consolidated into the company’s financial statements beginning with the next reporting period.

“The finalization of this process is further confirmation of the momentum we’ve been building across our operations,” said Mark Gaalswyk, CEO of Easy Environmental Solutions. “With Lifestyle now officially part of our organization, we’re expanding our manufacturing capacity and opening new markets for NanoVoid. At the same time, our global EasyFEN™ projects are advancing with signed contracts and deposits in place. These combined steps position us for the next phase of growth as we build a stronger, more globally connected company.”

Easy Environmental Solutions continues to advance commercialization of its NanoVoid™ and EasyFEN™ systems, technologies designed for recurring revenue and scalable deployment across global markets in water treatment, consumer food waste to microbial fertilizer systems, and sustainable agriculture.
