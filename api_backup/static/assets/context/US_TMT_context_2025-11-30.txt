[TITLE]Deal emerges from antitrust lawsuit that alleged landlords used pricing software for ‘algorithmic collusion’ to drive up rent:
[TEXT]
Landlords could no longer rely on rent-pricing software to quietly track each other’s moves and push rents higher using confidential data, under a settlement between RealPage Inc. and federal prosecutors to end what critics said was illegal “algorithmic collusion.”

The deal announced Monday by the Department of Justice follows a yearlong federal antitrust lawsuit, launched during the Biden administration, against the Texas-based software company. RealPage would not have to pay any damages or admit any wrongdoing. The settlement must still be approved by a judge.

RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees nationwide price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage’s clients charge the highest possible rent.

“RealPage was replacing competition with coordination, and renters paid the price,” said DOJ antitrust chief Gail Slater, who emphasized that the settlement avoided a costly, time-consuming trial.

Under the terms of the proposed settlement, RealPage can no longer use that real-time data to determine price recommendations. Instead, the only nonpublic data that can be used to train the software’s algorithm must be at least one year old.

“What does this mean for you and your family?” Slater said in a video statement. “It means more real competition in local housing markets. It means rents set by the market, not by a secret algorithm.”

RealPage attorney Stephen Weissman said the company is pleased the DOJ worked with them to settle the matter.

“There has been a great deal of misinformation

[TITLE]Govt to modernise Semi-Conductor Laboratory Mohali with ₹4,500 cr investment: Ashwini Vaishnaw:
[TEXT]
The government plans to invest ₹4,500 crore to modernise state-owned chip company Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) over the next three years, union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Friday.

Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), is the only integrated device manufacturing facility in the country providing end-to-end solutions for the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), opto-electronics devices, and Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) devices.

The minister said that the centre has requested the Punjab government for a 25-acre parcel of land to support the expansion.

"SCL will be modernised with an investment of Rs 4,500 crore over a period of the next three years," Vaishnaw said at the device handling ceremony here.

He said SCL will play a significant role in realising the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for semiconductors and assured that there is no question of privatising the facility.

The minister said production at SCL needs to be increased 100 times. "There is a need to bring substantial change in technology. We need to take a big jump over decades-old technology that we have here. SCL Mohali will provide a 'tape out facility' for startups," the minister said.

A "tape out facility" refers to a semiconductor fabrication plant wherein a final chip design is sent to the manufacturing unit after completion of the design phase.

He said that 300 university students, undergraduate, research fellows are using the world's latest EDA tools for chip design in the country and SCL will play a significant role in the production of those chips.

EDA tools, or Electronic Design Automation tools, are software used to design electronic systems such as integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs).

"We need to expand SCL Mohali. We have requested the Punjab government to allocate 25 acres of land. The faster you allocate the land, the faster it will help in the expansion of SCL Mohali," Vaishnaw said.

[TITLE]Taiwan 2025 GDP growth forecast hits 15-year high on surge in AI demand:
[TEXT]
TAIPEI :Taiwan's tech-heavy economy is expected to grow at its fastest pace in 15 years, riding the wave of demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the statistics office said on Friday, though U.S. tariffs are likely to cloud the outlook next year.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to expand by 7.37 per cent this year, much better than the 4.45 per cent pace it predicted in August and a level not seen since the 10.25 per cent posted in 2010, said the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.

Taiwan plays a pivotal role in the global AI supply chain for companies such as Nvidia and Apple. Its position is anchored by the world's largest maker of chips used in AI applications, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC).

"The growth beat expectations on strong demand for AI servers as US CSP (cloud service providers) continued to intensify their competition," said analyst Kevin Wang of Taishin Investment Advisory.

The agency, however, is cautious about the GDP growth outlook in 2026 over concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs.

Taiwan's exports to the United States are subject to a 20 per cent tariff, which Taipei is in talks to reduce, though semiconductors are currently excluded.

"Tariffs was not a big impact for this year, but it remains an uncertainty for next year," the agency said.

For 2026, the statistics office raised its GDP growth forecast to 3.54 per cent, above its earlier projection of 2.81 per cent.

The strong growth of the economy reinforces the view that Taiwan's central bank will leave interest rates unchanged in December, as most global central banks are taking a loose monetary policy, Wang said.

The statistics agency sees 2026 exports growing 6.32 per cent on year. It forecast the 2026 consumer price index at 1.61 per cent, which would be below the central bank's 2 per cent target and slightly lower than the 1.64 per cent forecast issued previously.

The agency also revised third quarter economic growth upwards to 8.21 per cent, compared with a preliminary 7.64 per cent.

[TITLE]Baidu is emerging as a major AI chip player in China to fill the Nvidia gap:
[TEXT]
A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.

Tech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country.

Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips.

Several analysts have upgraded their outlook on Baidu's stock over the past few weeks, citing the semiconductor business and forecasting the unit will gain more domestic orders.

This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. The company already uses a mix of its self-developed chips in its data centers to run its ERNIE AI models, as well as Nvidia products.

Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. It has sought to position itself as a so-called "full stack" AI offering with infrastructure made up of chips, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.

And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. Earlier this year, Kunlunxin won orders from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.

"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month.

While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export.

With Huawei — the leading player through its massive clusters of chips — out of the picture, analysts are suggesting Baidu will fill the void and its chip business is set for explosive growth.

"We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers," JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. "We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned."

The investment bank analysts forecast Baidu chips sales to increase six-fold to reach 8 billion Chinese yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2026.

Analysts at Macquarie estimate that Baidu's Kunlun chip unit could be valued at about $28 billion.

Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip.
