HSBC, together with its subsidiary HSBC Asia Pacific, has announced a proposal to privatise Hang Seng Bank through a deal valued at HK$106.1bn ($13.63bn).

Under this proposal, HSBC Asia Pacific would acquire all remaining shares of Hang Seng Bank, held by minority shareholders at HK$155 ($19.92) for each share.

Also, Hang Seng shares will be delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

The offer reflects a 33% premium over the undisturbed 30-day average closing price of HK$116.5 ($14.9), and values Hang Seng at HK$290bn ($37.2bn).

This valuation exceeds that of comparable peers in Hong Kong, indicating its confidence in the proposal’s fairness and attractiveness, said HSBC.

HSBC Group CEO Georges Elhedery said: “We will preserve Hang Seng’s brand, heritage, distinct customer proposition and branch network, while investing to unlock new strengths in products, services, and technology to deliver more choice and innovation for customers.

[TEXT]
HSBC Holdings' plan to take its Hang Seng Bank subsidiary private marked a key step in the UK lender's strategic overhaul, with Hong Kong's troubled property market potentially aiding the move, according to analysts.

The proposal on Thursday was "many months" in the making and had "nothing to do with the bad-debt situation" at Hang Seng Bank, HSBC group CEO Georges Elhedery said during a media round table in Hong Kong after the announcement. HSBC currently owns

[TITLE]Hong Kong as good as Wall Street for Chinese tech firms, Goldman Sachs banker says:
[TEXT]
In the Capital Connectors series, exclusive interviews with six influential Chinese and global bankers reveal the opportunities and challenges for Hong Kong in its evolution as an international financial hub.

Hong Kong has become the fundraising venue of choice for Chinese technology giants, surpassing the US thanks to growing liquidity, market reforms and proximity to their home market, according to a senior banker at Goldman Sachs.

With Chinese technology firms being a clear focus of international investors and expanding globally, Hong Kong would continue to be a "big beneficiary", said Jacky Leung, the bank's head of Hong Kong coverage and co-chief operating officer of the technology, media and telecom group for Asia excluding Japan.

India’s benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty traded higher on Tuesday, led by gains in IT shares after HCLTech posted upbeat quarterly results, while easing retail inflation strengthened expectations of a potential rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in December.The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 210.50 points, or 0.26%, to open at 82,537.55, while the NSE Nifty 50 advanced 57.30 points, or 0.23%, to start at 25,284.65.On the 30-share Sensex, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, Tata Steel, Infosys, and Reliance Industries led the gains, rising between 0.8% and 2%.Across sectors, IT stocks outperformed, with the Nifty IT index up 0.9%. Shares of HCLTech advanced 1.6% after the nation’s third-largest software exporter reaffirmed its full-year revenue growth guidance of 3%–5% and topped second-quarter revenue estimates.Broader markets also edged higher, with the smallcap and midcap indexes gaining 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.Meanwhile, India’s retail inflation fell to an eight-year low of 1.54% in September, government data showed Monday, as food prices cooled. The sharp moderation has bolstered expectations of a potential rate cut when the Reserve Bank of India meets in December.Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the market trends over the past year highlight a clear shift in investor preference. “A significant takeaway from the last one year market performance is the outperformance of large caps (Nifty up by 1.05%) and the underperformance of smallcaps (Nifty Smallcap index down by 4.77%),” he said, adding that public sector banks also stood out. “Equally significant is the outperformance of PSU banks (Nifty PSU Bank index up by 16.77%) and the huge underperformance of IT (Nifty IT down by 16.5%).”He noted that valuations have been a key driver behind these divergences. According to Vijayakumar, “IT stocks, particularly the large caps, are viewed as overvalued by the market since they are facing many headwinds and some strong structural issues. On the other hand, PSU stocks have been trading at very low valuations despite decent growth and robust balance sheets. This anomaly in valuations has been corrected by the market.”Vijayakumar expects this trend to persist but added that “in growth stocks like digital companies and renewable energy, their long-term growth potential will continue to attract investment despite high valuations.”“With Muhurat trading approaching,” he said, “there is room for a mild rally.”Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks later this month was tempered by doubts about a durable deal.Early gains in MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index outside Japan and S&P 500 futures faded after initial rebounds following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments that President Donald Trump remains on track to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.Trade tensions escalated as both nations began imposing port fees on ocean shipping firms, raising costs on global cargo routes.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.4%, while China’s CSI 300 dipped 0.1%. Taiwan led gains with a 0.8% jump as TSMC hit a record after OpenAI partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house AI chips. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.6% after Samsung projected a 32% jump in third-quarter operating profit, beating estimates. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.2% as markets reopened after a holiday, with the dollar steady at 152.31 yen.Gold climbed 1.1% to $4,155.90 an ounce, extending record gains, while Bitcoin fell 1.9% to $113,629.29 and Ether slipped 3% to $4,161.79.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net sellers on October 13 after four consecutive days of buying, offloading equities worth just over Rs 240 crore. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), in contrast, remained net buyers, investing Rs 2,333.42 crore.MORE TO COME...

[TEXT]
And while investors gave companies a “hall pass” on deferred tariff guidance in previous quarters, they are unlikely to be as generous this time around, said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank.

Many on Wall Street are convinced that months of elevated tariffs are already taking a toll that will be seen in third-quarter earnings: Deutsche Bank AG, for example, said S&P 500 earnings growth would have been a percentage-point higher in the quarter without the effects of tariffs.

After upending markets earlier this year, worries over global trade were again front and center on Friday, with President Donald Trump saying he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on “any and all critical software” beginning November 1.

Here’s a look at five key themes to watch as the results roll in.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other big US banks are scheduled to kick off the third-quarter reporting cycle next week while the spotlight will fall on tech-focused megacaps later this month.

[TITLE]China Markets Under Threat From Risk of Renewed US Trade War:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a revived trade war between Beijing and Washington threatens to undermine this year’s blistering rally in Chinese stocks and weigh on the yuan.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Global equities took a hit in US hours on Friday after President Donald Trump warned he would impose a “massive” increase of tariffs on Chinese goods. He later said he would put an additional 100% tariff on China from Nov. 1, as well as place export controls on critical software. He spoke out after Beijing unveiled curbs on the export of rare earths earlier in the week.

While Chinese markets will get their first chance to respond on Monday, any following of the US selloff may be tempered by weekend signals from the White House that it’s open to a deal and Trump declaring the US wanted to help, not hurt China.

Currencies including the Australian dollar edged higher in early trading Monday and the offshore yuan inched 0.1% higher against the dollar to pare Friday’s loss.

China’s equities and yuan may slide though “I’d expect that pressure to be more modest than I would’ve done a few hours ago before the Trump” post on social media, said Michael Brown, a strategist at Pepperstone Group. “But some weakness is the expectation.”

A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in the US plunged more than 6% on Friday in its biggest loss since trade tensions escalated in April. American equities also tumbled, with Nvidia Corp., which is caught in the middle of the two nations’ export controls negotiations, sliding nearly 5%. Emerging market currencies weakened.

A lasting deterioration of ties between the two largest economies could imperil one of the world’s best performing stock markets this year, as well as renew doubt over China’s investability.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index has climbed 31% in 2025 as Chinese equities benefited from the trade truce with the US in addition to optimism over the country’s growing heft in artificial intelligence. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has surged more than 100%, with Tencent Holdings Ltd. up almost 60%. The rally comes after the Hang Seng fell for four straight years through 2023.

Any sustained weakness in the yuan is typically negative for Asian currencies because the yuan has long been seen as an anchor for the region. Emerging-Asian currencies have underperformed most of their EM peers this year, with the Bloomberg Asia Dollar index up just 2.6% against the dollar. A broader index of EM currencies has climbed 6.4%, on track for its best year since 2017.

[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: It's AI's world and the Fed's just living in it:
[TEXT]
Traders work, as a screen broadcasts a news conference by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the Fed rate announcement, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Sept. 17, 2025.

Investors barely flinched Wednesday, despite the release of the Fed minutes and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

Discussions on rate cuts and shutdowns seemed to be mere background noise compared to the real force moving markets now, namely, artificial intelligence.

AI stocks such as Nvidia are now masters of the market narrative, driving record highs across the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

On the flip side, Oracle became the proverbial straw that broke the S&P500's seven-day winning streak Tuesday stateside.

But, to paraphrase Spider-Man, with great power, comes great scrutiny. The Bank of England warned that valuations appear "stretched," particularly for AI companies, adding that equity markets could be particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.

For now, Wall Street remains in hyperdrive, fueled by AI's promise and the hope that the Fed will keep cutting rates.

Investors may soon need to reckon with whether this AI-fueled rally is built on solid ground or it's swinging toward a cliff.
