[TEXT]
Ottawa, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global oncology biomarker
[Source link]: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/21/3192889/0/en/Oncology-Biomarker-Market-Accelerates-Toward-USD-113-5-Billion-by-2034.html


[TITLE]Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Market Outlook, 2025-2035 - New Drug Approvals are Redefining the Treatment Landscape:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Analysis and Forecast, 2025-2035" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market is witnessing robust growth fueled by advancements in understanding the disease pathophysiology, the emergence of targeted therapies for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and increasing diagnosis rates. Historically, management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was largely supportive, focusing on blood pressure control and symptom relief. However, the approval of tolvaptan (Jynarque) by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals marked a breakthrough as the first disease-modifying therapy that slows cyst growth and renal function decline by antagonizing vasopressin V2 receptors.

The rising prevalence of the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is one of the major factors driving the market. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease affects approximately 4 to 6 million people worldwide, with prevalence estimates ranging from 1 in 500 to 1,000 individuals. Increasing awareness and advancements in diagnostic tools such as high-resolution imaging techniques (MRI and ultrasound) and genetic testing - have enabled earlier and more accurate diagnosis. For instance, in the U.S., the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) reports that earlier detection is becoming more common, allowing patients to receive timely interventions that can delay disease progression. The global rise in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease diagnosis is expanding the patient pool requiring pharmacological treatment, which in turn is driving growth in the drug market.

Moreover, the approval of tolvaptan (marketed as Jynarque by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals) in 2018 by the FDA marked a significant milestone as the first disease-modifying therapy for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Tolvaptan works by blocking vasopressin V2 receptors to slow cyst growth and preserve kidney function. Clinical trials such as the TEMPO 3:4 study demonstrated a 30% reduction in kidney volume growth and a slower decline in kidney function among treated patients, positioning tolvaptan as a breakthrough in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease management. This success has encouraged increased R&D investments, with several pharmaceutical companies exploring next-generation agents to improve efficacy and safety profiles.

In addition, as global populations age, the number of patients with chronic conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is increasing. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients frequently develop hypertension, cardiovascular complications, and renal failure in their 40s and 50s. The World Bank estimates that the global population aged 65 and above will reach 1.5 billion by 2050, intensifying demand for chronic disease management. This demographic trend expands the need for comprehensive treatment options addressing both kidney function and associated comorbidities, thereby fueling growth in the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market.

However, the high treatment cost and limited treatment options are some of the factors hindering the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market growth. For instance, the annual cost of tolvaptan therapy can exceed $50,000 in the U.S., creating substantial affordability barriers for patients and healthcare systems. This high price limits access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where reimbursement and insurance coverage are limited.

Moreover, currently, tolvaptan is the only approved disease-modifying drug specifically for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, with most patients relying on supportive care such as blood pressure management using ACE inhibitors or ARBs. The scarcity of effective pharmacotherapies underscores a significant unmet medical need. This gap drives ongoing clinical trials for new candidates, including mTOR inhibitors like sirolimus, somatostatin analogs, and emerging gene therapies aimed at addressing disease progression more effectively.

Key players in the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market are adopting several strategic initiatives to gain a competitive edge and capitalize on growing opportunities. Leading companies such as Otsuka Pharmaceuticals are investing heavily in research and development to expand their portfolios with next-generation therapies that offer improved efficacy and safety over existing treatments, such as tolvaptan. For instance, Otsuka continues to enhance tolvaptan's clinical applications while exploring combination therapies and novel formulations to improve patient adherence and tolerability.

Additionally, companies are forming strategic collaborations and partnerships with biotech firms, academic institutions, and diagnostic companies to accelerate innovation and clinical trial success for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, thereby impelling the market growth.

[TITLE]Pasithea Therapeutics Announces Positive PAS-004 Tablet Pharmacokinetic (PK) Data in Ongoing Phase 1/1b Trial in Adult NF1 Patients:
[TEXT]
-- Tablet PK exposure increases proportionally with an increase in dose --

-- More favorable PK properties in tablets enable a lower dose to achieve the same exposure as the capsule formulation, with improved predictability and reduced variability --

-- Tablet steady state showing Cmax/Cmin ratio <2 --

MIAMI, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pasithea Therapeutics Corp. (Nasdaq: KTTA) (“Pasithea” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing PAS-004, a next-generation macrocyclic oral MEK inhibitor for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN), today announced positive tablet PK data from ongoing Phase 1/1b open-label study evaluating PAS-004 in adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with symptomatic and inoperable, incompletely resected, or recurrent plexiform neurofibromas ( NCT06961565 ).

Pharmacokinetics (PK)

PAS-004 has demonstrated in the tablet formulation (4mg and 8mg cohorts):

Linear PK and dose-proportionality

and PK curve with Cmax/Cmin ratio <2 , with Cmax and Cmin above the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) from our cellular assay

, with Cmax and Cmin above the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) from our cellular assay Long half-life (~57 hours)

Cohort 1 (4mg tablet) has demonstrated:

AUC : 1,120 ng·h/mL

Cmax : 58.1 ng/mL

Cmin : 37.6 ng/mL

Cohort 2 (8mg tablet) has demonstrated:

AUC : 2,290 ng·h/mL

Cmax : 118 ng/mL

Cmin : 75.4 ng/mL

Dose normalized exposures following once daily administration of PAS-004 tablets were approximately 3-fold higher than those following administration with the capsule formulation, resulting in the 8mg tablet area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax being slightly greater than those of the 22mg capsule. The tablet formulation has demonstrated less patient variability and a similar Tmax range when compared to the capsule formulation. This is consistent with the pre-clinical evaluation of the two formulations in the dog toxicology studies.

[TITLE]Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Market Outlook, 2025-2035 - New Drug Approvals are Redefining the Treatment Landscape:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Analysis and Forecast, 2025-2035" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market is witnessing robust growth fueled by advancements in understanding the disease pathophysiology, the emergence of targeted therapies for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and increasing diagnosis rates. Historically, management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was largely supportive, focusing on blood pressure control and symptom relief. However, the approval of tolvaptan (Jynarque) by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals marked a breakthrough as the first disease-modifying therapy that slows cyst growth and renal function decline by antagonizing vasopressin V2 receptors.

The rising prevalence of the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is one of the major factors driving the market. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease affects approximately 4 to 6 million people worldwide, with prevalence estimates ranging from 1 in 500 to 1,000 individuals. Increasing awareness and advancements in diagnostic tools such as high-resolution imaging techniques (MRI and ultrasound) and genetic testing - have enabled earlier and more accurate diagnosis. For instance, in the U.S., the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) reports that earlier detection is becoming more common, allowing patients to receive timely interventions that can delay disease progression. The global rise in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease diagnosis is expanding the patient pool requiring pharmacological treatment, which in turn is driving growth in the drug market.

Moreover, the approval of tolvaptan (marketed as Jynarque by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals) in 2018 by the FDA marked a significant milestone as the first disease-modifying therapy for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Tolvaptan works by blocking vasopressin V2 receptors to slow cyst growth and preserve kidney function. Clinical trials such as the TEMPO 3:4 study demonstrated a 30% reduction in kidney volume growth and a slower decline in kidney function among treated patients, positioning tolvaptan as a breakthrough in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease management. This success has encouraged increased R&D investments, with several pharmaceutical companies exploring next-generation agents to improve efficacy and safety profiles.

In addition, as global populations age, the number of patients with chronic conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is increasing. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients frequently develop hypertension, cardiovascular complications, and renal failure in their 40s and 50s. The World Bank estimates that the global population aged 65 and above will reach 1.5 billion by 2050, intensifying demand for chronic disease management. This demographic trend expands the need for comprehensive treatment options addressing both kidney function and associated comorbidities, thereby fueling growth in the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market.

However, the high treatment cost and limited treatment options are some of the factors hindering the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market growth. For instance, the annual cost of tolvaptan therapy can exceed $50,000 in the U.S., creating substantial affordability barriers for patients and healthcare systems. This high price limits access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where reimbursement and insurance coverage are limited.

Moreover, currently, tolvaptan is the only approved disease-modifying drug specifically for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, with most patients relying on supportive care such as blood pressure management using ACE inhibitors or ARBs. The scarcity of effective pharmacotherapies underscores a significant unmet medical need. This gap drives ongoing clinical trials for new candidates, including mTOR inhibitors like sirolimus, somatostatin analogs, and emerging gene therapies aimed at addressing disease progression more effectively.

Key players in the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease market are adopting several strategic initiatives to gain a competitive edge and capitalize on growing opportunities. Leading companies such as Otsuka Pharmaceuticals are investing heavily in research and development to expand their portfolios with next-generation therapies that offer improved efficacy and safety over existing treatments, such as tolvaptan.
