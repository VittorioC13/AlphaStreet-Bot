[TITLE]NTB secures approval to acquire HSBC Sri Lanka operations:

Nations Trust Bank (NTB) has received the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) approval for its previously announced acquisition of the Retail Banking operations of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sri Lanka (HSBC Sri Lanka).

In September this year, HSBC Sri Lanka signed a binding agreement to transfer its Retail Banking operations to NTB.

The acquisition would provide NTB with around 200,000 HSBC Sri Lanka customer accounts, including premium banking clients, retail loans and credit cards.

It is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

Upon closing, HSBC’s corporate and institutional banking operations in Sri Lanka will remain unchanged, continuing to serve international corporate clients and offering cross-border trade and investment services.

NTB said that the acquisition would strengthen its position in the premium retail banking segment and support its long-term growth objectives.

Nations Trust Bank director and CEO Hemantha Gunetilleke said “The approval from CBSL gives us the go-ahead to move forward with the acquisition process, which is currently progressing very well. We are now able to move into the next phase of the project with confidence.”

The sale of its retail banking business is part of HSBC Group’s simplification plan announced in October last year.

The decision follows a strategic review that determined divestment of the retail unit was the preferred course for the group and its stakeholders.

HSBC, at that time, said the reorganisation allows it to concentrate on areas where it has a competitive focus and growth prospects.

HSBC Sri Lanka CEO Mark Surgenor said: “Our priority during this period is to uphold the highest service levels for our customers and ensure that our colleagues are well supported during the transition into NTB.

“We are working closely with NTB towards a seamless transfer of banking services upon completion of the transaction.”

[TITLE]Fanatics lands retail and merchandising deal for 2026 FIFA World Cup:
[TEXT]
A Fanatics advertisement on the sideline billboard during the NWSL match between Houston Dash and Washington Spirit at Shell Energy Stadium on March 14, 2025 in Houston, Texas.

Fanatics has struck a deal to run retail and merchandising for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the company announced Thursday.

The global competition will see 104 matches played in 16 stadiums across the U.S., Canada and Mexico this coming summer.

"There is no larger sporting event in the entire world than the World Cup … we've been doing a lot of events; this is the biggest one we'll have done yet," said Andrew Low Ah Kee, CEO of Fanatics Commerce, the company's manufacturing and retail arm.

Over the last several years, Fanatics has overseen retail operations at international sporting events like MLB's Tokyo Series, the NFL's slate of international games, the NHL's Four Nations tournament and UEFA's Euro 2024 in Germany. Fanatics was also the retail partner of FIFA's Club World Cup tournament across the U.S. last summer.

As part of its deal with FIFA for the 2026 tournament, Fanatics will oversee the in-venue retail operations across all 16 locations, which are mostly NFL stadiums with seating capacity of more than 60,000 fans.

It will also have retail operations in the parking lot at each stadium, as well as a retail presence at each of FIFA's fan festival locations spread across the host cities. In total, Fanatics is forecasting it will have more than 2,000 point-of-sale locations during the tournament.

"In terms of the logistical complexity of it, it's very real, but I'm confident in our readiness," said Low Ah Kee, adding that Fanatics has already operated in all the venues where the tournament will be held.

While the length of the tournament – 39 days, to accommodate a larger field of 48 nations – could present another layer of complexity compared to one-off events or shorter tournaments, Low Ah Kee said the company is aiming to lean into the momentum that is built during a World Cup, capitalizing on matchups and moments that arise to create quick-strike products and other limited merchandise.

Fanatics has expanded its soccer-focused retail operations in recent years, and is a partner of MLS, a quarter of the Premier League clubs, and several of the biggest club teams across the world like PSG, Inter Milan and Juventus. It's also a partner to several national teams who will be competing, such as Argentina, England, France, Belgium and Germany.

Low Ah Kee said that Fanatics' existing relationships have helped the company better understand soccer fans. That means more fashion-forward products and, specifically, more scarves, Low Ah Kee said.

Fanatics is already in discussion with partners, manufacturers, brands and vendors to make sure that the product stays well stocked for what it expects to be an unprecedented sports retail moment.

"We think this could be a multiple of the biggest events that we've run historically," Low Ah Kee said, declining to share specific figures.

Fanatics' execution of the 2026 World Cup will also set the stage for another massive undertaking: The company will oversee retail operations for the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.

Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through 2036. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

[TITLE]Trump open to lowering tariffs on some goods, raising others:

Key Takeaways President Donald Trump says he may lower tariffs on some goods and raise them on others.

Businesses are warning of possible price hikes due to existing tariffs as inventories run low.

Share this article

President Donald Trump may adjust his tariff policies, including possible carveouts on certain consumer goods, he said in a recent interview with Politico. However, Trump warned that tariffs on other products could rise.

Trump said he had already made small tariff carveouts, citing coffee. He claimed tariffs are bringing car companies back to the US.

He also said the country had lost its chip market under past presidents and recounted asking Intel for 10% of the company in exchange for government help, claiming the US made $40 billion. He added that $18 trillion is “coming into our country” because of tariffs.

The potential policy shift comes as businesses have indicated that tariff-related price increases are expected as inventories deplete.

The Trump administration has already made trade adjustments, reducing tariffs on certain Chinese goods as part of a temporary deal to resume trade in rare-earth elements and improve relations. The US government has also moderated tariffs on imports from countries like Canada and Mexico to balance trade and address economic impacts.

[TITLE]L'Oreal to up stake in skin care firm Galderma to 20%:
[TEXT]
L'Oreal said today it will raise its stake in Swiss skin care firm Galderma to 20% with an acquisition from a group of major shareholders, a step which could earn the French company a bigger cut of profits from the injectable cosmetics market.

L'Oreal is buying the stake for an undisclosed sum from a consortium led by Swedish private equity firm EQT, which includes Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Auba Investment Pte Ltd. The deal is due to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Galderma, which has a market capitalisation of over $48 billion according to LSEG data, was originally set up as a joint venture between Swiss consumer goods giant Nestle and L'Oreal before the latter sold its 50% stake in 2014.

L'Oreal's additional stake comes two months after it agreed to pay €4 billion for Kering's beauty business. It has also said it will study a potential investment in Armani.

"We are pleased with L'Oreal's increased investment, which affirms our direction and the meaningful value creation we expect in the years ahead," said Galderma CEO Flemming Ornskov.

Speaking to analysts in September, L'Oreal CFO Christophe Babule said the company was "quite happy" with the original Galderma stake it purchased last year.

Galderma listed an initial tranche of its stock in March 2024, and has so far floated more than half of it, according to LSEG data. The company's share price has tripled since that IPO.

L'Oreal said Galderma's board will consider nominating two non-independent directors from L'Oreal to replace the EQT-led consortium representatives at the 2026 annual general meeting.

L'Oreal has also invested in clinics in China and the US to learn more

Food Processing Secretary A P Das Joshi on Thursday asked corporates to invest more in the sector to enhance the processing level from the current low of 12 per cent and also boost exports of processed food items.Addressing a CII event here, the secretary emphasised the need to dispel the myth that processed food is inherently bad.He also highlighted that the labour codes would benefit the sector.Joshi said that the issues related to the HFSS (High fat, sugar, salt) and FOPNL (Front-of-pack nutrition labelling) are under "very, very active consideration of the government" and there could be some decision in the near future.He was addressing a session on 'Scaling Food Processing for Rural Prosperity and Jobs' organised as part of the CII IndiaEdge 2025."We have 24 lakh units across the country, and only 2 per cent are organised. I look forward to a higher level of investment from the captains of the industry," Joshi said, adding that there is a huge scope for FDI and private domestic investment.He also emphasised the need for formalisation of the informal."Whatever you process ultimately comes from lakhs of farmers. So whenever we are doing the value addition, a part of it goes to the farmers. So rural prosperity, it is necessary that we increase the processing level. We process hardly 12 per cent of our food.

[TITLE]Running Shoes From Nike, Brooks, Asics and Others Fuel Footwear Growth at Academy Sports + Outdoors in Q3:
[TEXT]
Academy Sports + Outdoors is seeing greater strength in footwear.

“The best part of our business has been performance running,” said Matt McCabe, the outdoor retailer’s executive vice president and chief merchant, in a telephone interview Tuesday after the firm posted third quarter earnings results. “So really Nike‘s Vomero, Brooks’ Glycerin, Asics’ Gel-Nimbus and New Balance’s FuelCell Rebel has been good for us.”

McCabe also noted Adidas’ new Adizero EVO SL Running shoe that also did well for the retailer. “All those are exciting too because they’re on the better parts of our business,” he said.

The chief merchandising officer also cited the athletic slide business as a category that has seen a “nice comeback in [its] resurgence [and] that business is up double-digits for us.” He said leading the charge has been the ultra comfort slide, such as the Nike Reactx Rejuven8 shoe and the Adidas Adilette Comfort Slide.

NEW YORK, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NasdaqGS: GIII) (“G-III” or the “Company”) today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, ended October 31, 2025 and announces approval of a quarterly dividend.

Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a strong third quarter with gross margins and earnings far exceeding our expectations. This was driven by the strength of our go-forward portfolio, particularly our owned brands, as well as a healthy mix of full-price sales and our mitigation efforts against tariffs. I am pleased with how our brands are resonating with consumers and encouraged by the solid demand we have seen throughout the holiday season to date.”

Mr. Goldfarb concluded, “Looking ahead, we are raising our fiscal 2026 earnings guidance to reflect our third quarter outperformance tempered by the uncertainties around the consumer environment and tariff-related margin pressures. I am extremely proud of our teams for executing on our strategic priorities and delivering strong profitability. With our powerful brand portfolio and best-in-class operating model, we are well-positioned to achieve our fiscal 2026 outlook. Our strong financial profile gives us the ability to return capital directly to stockholders including through our newly initiated dividend program, while also continuing to pursue strategic opportunities to drive profitable growth.”

Results of Operations

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026

Net sales for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 decreased 9% to $988.6 million compared to $1.09 billion in the prior year’s third quarter.

Net income for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 was $80.6 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to $114.8 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, in the prior year’s third quarter.

Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.90 for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 compared to $2.59 in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share excludes (i) in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, $2.4 million of professional fees related to a potential strategic opportunity that did not come to fruition, (ii) in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, asset impairments of $1.6 million, (iii) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, $0.5 million in one-time severance expenses related to a closed warehouse and (iv) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a $1.6 million write-off of deferred financing costs related to the redemption of our senior secured notes (the “Notes”). The aggregate effect of these exclusions was equal to $0.06 per diluted share in the third quarter of this year and $0.04 per diluted share in last year’s third quarter.

Balance Sheet as of Third Quarter Fiscal 2026

Inventories increased 3% to $547.1 million this year compared to $532.5 million last year.

Total debt decreased 95% to $10.6 million this year compared to $224.2 million last year with the Company ending the quarter in a net cash position of $173.5 million compared to a net debt position of $119.5 million in the same period last year.

Capital Allocation

Share repurchases of 209,851 for $5.4 million were made in the third quarter and 2,158,276 for $49.8 million in the year-to-date period.

G-III announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new quarterly dividend program to evolve its strategic use of capital. The Board of Directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 29, 2025, to all stockholders of record as of December 15, 2025. The Company intends to pay dividends quarterly in the future, subject to market conditions and approval by the Board of Directors.

Outlook

The Company has updated guidance for fiscal 2026, which reflects the strength of our third-quarter earnings outperformance, along with a disciplined view of the current consumer landscape and the expected effects of tariffs on our top and bottom lines. Based on current tariff rates, the Company anticipates the gross impact of tariffs will now be approximately $135 million. This has been partially offset through vendor participation, strategic sourcing shifts, and targeted price increases. The remaining unmitigated impact, reflected in fiscal 2026 guidance, is now estimated at $65 million.

Fiscal 2026

Net sales are expected to be approximately $2.98 billion (previous guidance $3.02 billion). This compares to net sales of $3.18 billion for fiscal 2025.

Net income is expected to be between $121.0 million and $126.0 million (previous guidance $112.0 million and $122.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $2.72 and $2.82 (previous guidance $2.53 and $2.73). This compares to net income of $193.6 million, or $4.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2025.

Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2026 is expected to be between $125.0 million and $130.0 million (previous guidance $113.0 million and $123.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90 (previous guidance $2.55 and $2.75). This compares to non-GAAP net income of $203.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $4.42 for fiscal 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2026 is expected to be between $208.0 million and $213.0 million (previous guidance $198.0 million and $208.0 million) compared to adjusted EBITDA of $325.9 million in fiscal 2025.

Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $1.5 million.

Tax rate for fiscal 2026 is estimated to be 29.5%.

[TITLE]PODpartner Launches Enhanced Garment and Print Operations to Support High-End Fashion Brands:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, United States, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PODpartner has launched a significantly upgraded production infrastructure designed to give creators the flexibility and precision needed to build legitimate high-end fashion brands. For years, designers have asked simple questions like, “Can I print on this part of the garment?” or “Can I mix embroidery with a printed design?” and the industry’s usual reply has been a list of limits. Most POD services restrict print areas, rely on slow workflows or offer only one decoration method per garment. PODpartner’s upgraded facility answers these challenges head-on by widening print coverage, supporting more advanced design techniques and delivering premium apparel with no minimums, giving creators the freedom to bring their ideas to life without compromise.

The expanded operation supports up to 18 print positions on a single garment, opening space for pockets, cuffs, hems and other areas that traditional POD providers rarely touch. It also makes it possible to place DTG printing and embroidery within the same design area, something many competitors still label as “not possible” due to their fragmented setup and reliance on outsourced blanks. These upgrades speak directly to the needs of designers who want layered textures, multi-directional layouts and fashion-grade detailing rather than basic merch.

PODpartner notes that its refined production workflow removes friction that typically slows down POD fulfillment. With faster movement between garment preparation, printing, embroidery and finishing, orders progress more quickly, giving brands the reaction speed required in fast-moving digital commerce environments.

Addressing Structural Constraints in the POD Industry

Print-on-demand has grown rapidly over the last decade due to its low barriers to entry and appeal to online sellers seeking to avoid inventory risk. Most conventional POD providers operate as print shops that source blank apparel from third-party manufacturers, applying either printing or embroidery as a final step. While this approach has enabled scale, it has also introduced inherent constraints.

Outsourcing blank garments limits control over fabric selection, garment construction, and consistency. In addition, production workflows are often separated across multiple facilities, making it difficult or impractical to combine different decoration methods on the same product. As a result, many POD services restrict design placements to a small number of standard positions and ship products with extended fulfillment timelines.

PODpartner’s vertically integrated model was designed to address these structural issues by rethinking how on-demand apparel is manufactured and decorated.

Manufacturing Roots Inform a Different Approach

Unlike many POD platforms that evolved from software or marketplace models, PODpartner was founded by a team with extensive experience in garment manufacturing. Rather than adding manufacturing capabilities after launching a POD operation, the company was built by adapting an existing factory infrastructure to support individualized, on-demand production.

The core challenge, according to the company, was aligning traditional bulk manufacturing systems with the fragmented and real-time demand patterns of digital commerce. Conventional garment factories are optimized for large production runs of identical items, while POD workflows require rapid execution of single, highly customized orders.

PODpartner spent several years redesigning its production logic, inventory planning, and workflow systems to enable this transition. The result is a model that applies industrial-scale manufacturing expertise to on-demand fulfillment without sacrificing speed or flexibility.

48-Hour Production Enabled by Vertical Integration

One of the outcomes of the integrated factory model is PODpartner’s ability to produce most orders within 48 hours. The company attributes this improvement to the elimination of what it describes as “dead time” in traditional POD workflows.

In conventional models, the majority of fulfillment time is spent waiting for blank garments to be shipped from external suppliers and transferred between printing and embroidery facilities. By co-locating garment inventory, printing equipment, embroidery stations, and quality control processes in the same physical environment, PODpartner removes these delays.

The facility is supported by proprietary workflow software that assigns incoming orders to specific production lines based on fabric type, print method, and decoration requirements at the moment they are received. This dynamic routing allows the factory to respond more efficiently to sudden increases in demand, such as those driven by viral social media trends or time-sensitive product launches.

Expanded Design Capabilities Through 18 Print Positions

PODpartner’s integrated setup supports up to 18 print positions per garment, significantly expanding the creative range available to designers. In addition to standard placements such as the front, back, and sleeves, the system allows printing on areas including interior labels, pockets, cuffs, shoulders, hems, and other non-traditional locations.

This flexibility enables brands to approach garment design holistically rather than treating printing as an afterthought applied to a limited canvas. According to the company, the goal is to allow creators to design products from all angles, closer to how garments are developed in traditional fashion houses.

Combined Print and Embroidery Using Hybrid Workflow Technology

A key feature of this technological innovation is the ability to apply both DTG printing and embroidery to the same garment, including within the same design area. Achieving this capability requires careful sequencing, equipment calibration, and curing processes to avoid damage to materials or machinery.

PODpartner refers to its approach as a “Hybrid Workflow,” which treats the garment as a single production unit rather than as a sequence of unrelated decoration steps. In traditional environments, embroidering a garment before printing can raise thread surfaces that interfere with print heads, while printing before embroidery can introduce curing and alignment challenges.

By controlling the entire workflow and employing proprietary sequencing and calibration processes, PODpartner reports it is able to safely and consistently combine these techniques, opening the door to layered, three-dimensional design effects typically associated with premium streetwear and luxury apparel.

Support for Professional Embroidery Standards

Technical advancements have greatly expanded embroidery options. PODpartner accepts industry-standard DST embroidery files and allows up to 15 thread colors per design, compared to the more limited file formats and color options common among many POD providers.

This approach is intended to better support professional designers and brands that require precision, depth, and color complexity in their embroidered elements. According to PODpartner, embroidery is not treated as a secondary add-on but as a core design medium equal in importance to printing.

Jumbo DTG Printing for Full-Garment Designs

As part of its manufacturing expansion, PODpartner has introduced jumbo DTG printing with a maximum print area of 24 inches by 24 inches. This capability allows designers to create large-scale graphics that cover substantial portions of a garment, rather than the smaller rectangular prints that have become standard across much of the POD market.

The company states that jumbo DTG printing enables full-garment visuals with consistent color saturation, even on dark or heavyweight fabrics. This aligns with feedback from streetwear brands seeking designs that resemble traditional cut-and-sew fashion rather than promotional merchandise.

Zero-Inventory Branding and On-Demand Customization

Beyond garment production itself, PODpartner’s model extends to branding and packaging. The company offers on-demand hang tags, custom labels, and packaging elements produced per order, without requiring pre-purchased inventory or minimum quantities.

This approach allows small businesses and individual creators to present fully branded products without significant upfront investment. According to PODpartner, the ability to include custom branding elements has proven to be a key factor in helping sellers perceive their operations as legitimate fashion brands rather than simple merch stores.

The platform also provides free Shopify customization tools that allow end customers to personalize products during the purchasing process. These tools are intended to increase customer engagement and reduce post-purchase uncertainty by involving buyers directly in the creation of their items.

Quality Control Embedded at Every Stage

To maintain consistency across customized, single-unit orders, PODpartner employs a multi-stage quality control process referred to internally as a “Gatekeeper” system. Inspections are conducted at several points, including fabric sourcing, blank preparation, post-production review, and final packaging.

The company combines manual inspection with automated analysis to identify defects or inconsistencies before products are shipped. In the event of production errors or carrier-related delays, PODpartner states that it absorbs associated costs under its delay compensation policy to protect sellers’ reputations.

Competitive Context

PODpartner emphasizes that traditional POD providers operate effectively within their own models but that those models impose unavoidable limitations. By contrast, owning the full production pipeline allows PODpartner to address design and fulfillment challenges as engineering problems rather than logistical barriers.

Key differences cited by the company include control over fabric sourcing, expanded print placement options, combined decoration processes, larger print formats, and faster production times.

Ongoing Product Development

Innovation remains an ongoing focus for PODpartner. In addition to jumbo DTG printing, the company has announced plans to introduce heat transfer vinyl (HTV) capabilities, enabling textured finishes and alternative surface effects not achievable through DTG alone.

According to PODpartner, these features are being developed in response to direct feedback from the more than 3,000 international brands currently using the platform.

Expanding Access to Fashion Manufacturing

PODpartner states that its long-term objective is to reduce the barriers traditionally associated with launching a fashion brand. By eliminating inventory risk, minimum order quantities, and supply chain opacity, the company aims to make professional-grade apparel manufacturing accessible to a broader range of creators.

The company believes that as production constraints are removed, creative differentiation becomes the primary competitive factor for emerging fashion brands.

[TITLE]Running Shoes From Nike, Brooks, Asics and Others Fuel Footwear Growth at Academy Sports + Outdoors in Q3:
[TEXT]
Academy Sports + Outdoors is seeing greater strength in footwear.

“The best part of our business has been performance running,” said Matt McCabe, the outdoor retailer’s executive vice president and chief merchant, in a telephone interview Tuesday after the firm posted third quarter earnings results. “So really Nike‘s Vomero, Brooks’ Glycerin, Asics’ Gel-Nimbus and New Balance’s FuelCell Rebel has been good for us.”

McCabe also noted Adidas’ new Adizero EVO SL Running shoe that also did well for the retailer. “All those are exciting too because they’re on the better parts of our business,” he said.

The chief merchandising officer also cited the athletic slide business as a category that has seen a “nice comeback in [its] resurgence [and] that business is up double-digits for us.” He said leading the charge has been the ultra comfort slide, such as the Nike Reactx Rejuven8 shoe and the Adidas Adilette Comfort Slide.

“I think a lot of that has to do with comfort. And I think probably the second part of that is that if a customer is stretched for funds, a $30 slide is less expensive than some of the alternatives,” McCabe said.

[TITLE]Walmart just extended its Christmas Eve delivery hours:

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

As Christmas approaches, Walmart is giving shoppers something pretty much everyone can use: a little more time.

Imagine you're just arriving to Christmas Eve dinner with your in-laws and your niece says she's been wanting a talking plush Bluey doll.

You find it in your Walmart app, place the order in a tap, and by the time dessert is ready, your gift is at the doorstep. (You can even get the whipped cream you forgot to bring for the pie, too.)

Such last-minute shopping options are becoming increasingly possible as major retailers make a big push into ultrafast delivery.

Case in point: Walmart told Business Insider exclusively that its shoppers will be able to place store-fulfilled express delivery orders as late as 5 p.m. local time on Christmas Eve — a full hour later than last year.

"More people are using Express Delivery to get their items faster, and December is when it truly shines," Walmart's chief e-commerce officer David Guggina said in a statement. "No one delivers for customers like Walmart, from the first Holiday deal to the final gift on Christmas Eve."

The retail giant can now reach 95% of US households in three hours or less, and the company has said that more than a third of shoppers opt to pay extra for three-hour-or-less delivery.

Those express delivery numbers jump by 2.5X in December compared with the year's average, the company said.

The company also told Business Insider that it recently rolled out a new "Get it Now" option in the Walmart app, which shows shoppers an estimated number of minutes to receive an item, and lets them place the order in one tap.

Walmart said earlier this month that it fulfilled its fastest Black Friday order in 10 minutes, with big increases in both the volume and speed of deliveries fulfilled from its stores.

But Walmart isn't the only player in the ultrafast delivery game: Amazon and Target are also racing to offer last-minute fulfillment options on Christmas Eve.

Target says customers can get orders within two hours via curbside or in-store pickup, or opt for same-day delivery for a $9.99 fee, with stores closing at 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve.

And Amazon will show an "Arrives before Christmas" message on items that can be delivered as late as Christmas Eve via delivery or one of the company's 25,000 pickup locations.

Correction, December 9, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the delivery category that more than a third of Walmart shoppers opt to pay for — it is three-hours-or-less delivery.

[TITLE]The state of retail media | RMNs expand marketers’ reach via off-site advertising:
[TEXT]
This State of the Industry report, with partner insights from Instacart, explores how brands and agencies are expanding their audience reach through off-site retail media advertising.

Retail media advertising’s popularity has surged over the past few years, with many retailers increasing their investments in this space as others venture into retail media for the first time. There are now more than 200 retail media networks in various states of growth or stasis, according to data from Mimbi.

However, while retail media remains one of the fastest-growing areas of advertising, maintaining that growth is becoming harder to achieve. According to a January report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau, commerce ad spend is expected to grow 15.6% in 2025, compared to 25.1% growth in 2024. EMarketer, meanwhile, is projecting that retail media will grow by 17.5% this year, but by just 10.4% by 2029.

Although RMNs have historically limited ad placements to their own digital properties, many RMNs have begun extending their ad offerings to off-site channels like social media, CTV and email in an effort to improve growth opportunities and to expand reach.

Partnerships with these types of platforms have allowed RMNs to open up ad inventory across the internet, essentially repositioning themselves from performance marketing channels to one-stop ad shops that can deliver full-funnel marketing opportunities for advertisers.

For this State of the Industry report, Digiday and Instacart surveyed 141 brand and agency respondents in September of this year to learn how they are expanding their audience reach through off-site retail media advertising. This report also covers how respondents are activating across off-site retail media, which off-site channels they’re spending on and the challenges they face within retail media.

“The way consumers engage with media has shifted significantly, with more time spent across various digital platforms like CTV and social media,” said Adam Silverblatt, head of off-platform sales and strategy at Instacart. “Media strategies have evolved in response to this behavior, focusing on reaching audiences where their attention is, whether they’re watching streaming, scrolling on their phones or navigating social platforms. This evolution allows RMNs to move up the marketing funnel, positioning themselves as comprehensive media partners for brands.”

01 Marketers increase ad spend on off-site retail media channels

Over the past two years, marketers have increased their ad spend on RMNs’ off-site media channels like social media, streaming platforms and email — a clear indication of their interest in broadening audience reach through these channels.

According to the Digiday and Instacart survey, nearly two-thirds of brand and agency respondents (62%) said that their off-site media spend on RMNs has increased since 2023. Less than one-quarter of respondents (22%) said their off-site RMN media spend has remained the same, and only 8% of respondents said their off-site RMN media spend has decreased over the past two years.

When it comes to how marketers are dividing their larger retail media budgets among today’s more than 200 RMNs, nearly three-quarters of brand and agency respondents (70%) said that they use four or more unique RMNs.

This disbursement of budgets and ads underscores the overcrowded nature of the current retail media marketplace, with hundreds of RMNs — including the growing number owned by major department stores and big-box stores — competing for marketers’ and consumers’ attention.

“As consumer shopping behavior continues to become more fragmented — with audiences no longer confined to a single retailer or platform, moving seamlessly between physical stores, e-commerce sites, apps and social commerce — the majority of marketers feel the need to meet consumers where they shop to ensure their products are top-of-mind regardless of shopping channel,” Silverblatt said.

“This also creates the marketers’ challenge of navigating a complex advertising ecosystem and puts growing pressure on marketers to figure out budget allocations and how to best optimize campaigns across a fragmented digital landscape,” he added.

Within off-site retail media, social media and programmatic media tied for the No. 1 channel in which survey respondents said they spend the majority of their budgets — 85% percent of survey respondents selected social media and programmatic media respectively.

CTV was marketers’ second-most used off-site retail media channel, with 68% of survey respondents selecting it as the off-site channel that receives the majority of their budget. Just one-fifth of marketers (20%) said that they allocate the majority of their budget to off-site email.

RMNs’ partnerships with tech platforms like Meta, Roku and Pinterest appeal to advertisers because of the ability to access robust first-party data that can be used to target relevant shoppers across platforms.

Likewise, RMNs have continued to expand their self-service capabilities and automate the advertising process when possible to enhance their programmatic capabilities. In addition to leveraging a retailer’s valuable first-party data to deliver highly targeted and personalized ads, brands benefit from the efficiency and scale of programmatic technology.

What began as experimentation with tapping into first-party retail media data across off-site platforms has shifted to a more strategic approach, according to Silverblatt. “As marketers have gained a clearer understanding of the available capabilities, they are increasingly focused on developing full-funnel strategies that extend beyond the point of sale to influence consumers earlier in their purchase journey,” he said. “With advancements in retail media data and CTV shoppable formats, brands are better positioned to engage consumers during the discovery and browsing phases, ultimately shortening the path to purchase and driving greater impact across channels.”

“Retail media networks are no longer just a point-of-sale tactic — they’ve become a bridge between commerce and media,” Lauren Lavin, executive director of NA Commerce at WPP Media, added. “By combining retailer first-party data with programmatic scale and emerging shoppable formats, brands can now influence consumers much earlier in the journey and carry that relevance through to conversion. The opportunity lies in connecting these data sets to deliver more intelligent, measurable outcomes for brands.”

02 Marketers find retail media most effective for engaging consumers

Overall, marketers who use retail media advertising find it most effective for engaging consumers at the middle of the funnel. More than half of survey respondents (51%) said retail media marketing is most effective for mid-funnel marketing, while less than one-quarter of respondents (24%) said it is most effective for driving conversions or lower-funnel marketing. Only 9% of respondents said they find retail media advertising most effective for generating brand awareness, or top-of-funnel marketing.

While on-site RMN ads are inherently lower-funnel because of their proximity to the point of checkout, off-site retail media activations allow advertisers to position ads further up the funnel and apply retailers’ first-party customer data holistically across the open web.

“Retail media is redefining how brands connect with consumers in the moments that shape their decisions,” WPP Media’s Lavin said. “It’s evolved into one of the most effective channels for engaging shoppers during the research and comparison phase, when intent is high and attention is focused. As it extends beyond retailer-owned environments, retail media is enabling brands to deliver messages that are timely, relevant and genuinely useful rather than intrusive.”

In particular, mid-funnel marketing is important for brands that face significant competition in their categories, like CPG companies and other food advertisers, because mid-funnel marketing reaches shoppers during the research and consideration portion of the consumer journey — an essential moment for engaging shoppers’ attention.

“Retail media can help capture and influence decisions from consumers who are actively browsing and comparing products, but haven’t committed to a specific brand or product yet,” Silverblatt at Instacart said. “First-party retail media audiences can help marketers reach these high-intent audiences and drive them further down the path to purchase.”

Although only 15% of respondents said that retail media advertising is most effective for full-funnel marketing, Silverblatt explained that marketers can build comprehensive retail media marketing strategies by taking advantage of RMNs’ diverse ad placements.

“For example, at the top of the funnel, retail media can drive brand awareness through high-impact placements at scale, such as using streaming video placements,” he said. “To engage consumers in the consideration phase, marketers can utilize social placements or ad formats like carousel and catalog ads, which work particularly well in reaching audiences in discovery mode. For lower-funnel conversions, retail media directly connects advertisers to consumers at the point of purchase, such as sponsored product ads on a retailer site to get consumers to add to cart and purchase. When you bring all of these placements together, you start to build a full-funnel strategy that reaches consumers where they are and aligns with consumer mindsets at every stage.”

[TITLE]Core, James Resnick pick up Publix-anchored center in Plantation for $53M:
[TEXT]
Core Investment Properties Fund and a partner bought a Publix-anchored shopping center in Plantation for $53 million.

Grocery-anchored retail plazas are hot commodities in South Florida, as the asset class has proven resilient to e-commerce and other market headwinds.

Miami-based Core and Miami Beach-based investor James Resnick purchased the 184,300-square-foot Jacaranda Plaza at 8101-8373 West Sunrise Boulevard from Austin-based Epic Real Estate Partners and Chicago-based Heitman, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyers borrowed $34.5 million from U.S. Bank.

The price amounts to $288 per square foot.

Jacaranda Plaza consists of three one-story buildings completed in 1974 and 1999 on 16.2 acres, Vizzda records show. It was renovated in 2013.

Aside from Publix, the shopping center also is anchored by Ross Dress for Less. Other tenants include Five Below, Planet Fitness, Dollar Tree and nurse registry Value Care At Home.

An entity tied to Epic –– led by Daniel Holland, Jason Maddox and Nick Tortorice –– had paid $29.3 million for the plaza in 2016, Vizzda records show. In 2022, Epic and Heitman formed a joint venture through which Epic recapitalized five properties, including Jacaranda Plaza, according to a joint news release issued at the time.
