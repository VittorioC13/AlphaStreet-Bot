[TITLE]Oil steadies on reports of US-Russia deal but ends week about 5% lower:
[TEXT]
SINGAPORE (Reuters): Oil held steady on Friday as markets awaited a meeting in the coming days between Russian president Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, but prices marked their steepest weekly losses since late June on a tariff-hit economic outlook.

Brent crude futures settled 16 cents, or 0.2%, higher at US$66.59 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were unchanged at US$63.88.

Brent fell 4.4% over the week, while WTI finished 5.1% lower than last Friday's close.

US crude fell over 1% earlier in the session after Bloomberg News reported that Washington and Moscow were aiming to reach a deal to halt the war in Ukraine that would lock in Russia's occupation of territory seized during its military invasion.

US and Russian officials are working towards an agreement on territories for a planned summit meeting between Trump and Putin as early as next week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The potential meeting raises expectations of a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine, which could lead to eased sanctions on Russia, and comes as trade tensions have been on the rise between Trump and buyers of Russian oil.

This week, Trump threatened to increase tariffs on India if it kept purchasing Russian oil. Trump also said China, the largest buyer of Russian crude, could be hit with tariffs similar to those levied against Indian imports.

"Various non-oil considerations are at play, including fears over the impact of tariffs and the headlines flying over the last few days regarding a Trump and Putin meeting in the near term," said Neil Crosby, an energy market analyst at Sparta Commodities.

"Headline risk is particularly strong currently with flip-flopping regarding who will turn up to a meeting over Ukraine and under what circumstances."

Higher U.S. tariffs on imports from a host of trade partners went into effect on Thursday, raising concern over economic activity and demand for crude oil, ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.

OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, adding to supply.

The U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 411 this week.

"Bearish sentiment has returned this week as key OPEC+ members announced a second 'quadruple' output unwind for September (thus fully restoring their extra voluntary cuts of 2.2 mmb/d) and President Trump's sweeping import tariffs took effect against most countries," analysts at FGE NexantECA said.

Trump on Thursday also said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve, fuelling expectations of a more dovish policy ahead.

Lower interest rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and can boost economic growth and demand for oil.

The dollar firmed on Friday but headed for a weekly fall. A stronger dollar hurts demand for dollar-denominated crude from foreign buyers.

Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to August 5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.

[TITLE]Despite war criticism, Egypt signs record deal to purchase natural gas from Israel:
[TEXT]
Egypt has signed the largest-ever deal for the export of Israeli natural gas, Globes reported.

The Leviathan partners agreed to sell 130 billion cubic meters (BCM) of gas to Egypt for $35 billion via Blue Ocean Energy. This will triple the amount of gas that is sold to Egypt from the Leviathan offshore field.

NewMed Energy (TASE: NWMD) CEO Yossi Abu said: "This is a historic day. Leviathan, the biggest natural gas field in the Mediterranean, is a tool for changing the strategic reality."

Leviathan was discovered in 2020, 130 kilometers (81 miles) west of Haifa. It was estimated to hold 535 billion cubic meters (18.9 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas, along with 34.1 million barrels of condensate. Israel began pumping gas from the field in 2019.

Egypt's decision to purchase a record amount of natural gas from Israel comes as Egypt has escalated its criticism of Israel for the war against the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza.

On Tuesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi accused Israel of genocide. "The war in Gaza is no longer a conflict aimed at political objectives or the release of hostages, but a war of famine, genocide, and an attempt to eliminate the Palestinian question,” he said.

[TITLE]Sixth Street takes 38% of Italian renewable energy firm Sorgenia in $4.6 billion deal:
[TEXT]
MILAN (Reuters) -U.S. investment firm Sixth Street said on Monday it had agreed to buy 38% of Sorgenia, in a deal that values the Italian renewable energy company at 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion).

The transaction allows Spanish infrastructure fund Asterion Industrial Partners to exit Sorgenia's capital, while F2i, Italy's main infrastructure fund, retains its position as the leading shareholder in Sorgenia, with a 62% stake.

Under the agreement, F2i will transfer to Sorgenia its wind and solar power generation assets in Italy and Spain: EF Solare, Renovalia and Renovalia Tramontana.

Asterion, which held 27.6% of Sorgenia, first invested in the company in 2020 supporting its efforts to build a position as a significant player in Europe's green energy transition.

"This agreement establishes Sorgenia as one of the leading energy infrastructure platforms in Europe," Sixth Street partner Richard Sberlati said.

Sorgenia's renewable portfolio spans solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric plants.

The company currently operates approximately 1,700 megawatt (MW) of installed renewable capacity and is pursuing development projects totalling an additional 5,000 MW.

Rothschild & Co advised Sixth Street, together with law firm Cleary Gottlieb.

Lazard, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mediobanca acted as financial advisers to F2i and Pedersoli Gattai as legal adviser. BofA Securities, Nomura and Societe Generale each advised one of the F2i funds involved in the transaction. ($1 = 0.8636 euros)

[TITLE]Electronics and renewable energy investments set to dominate state’s investment announcements in Thoothukudi:
[TEXT]
As the Tamil Nadu government kicks off its regional investment summits ‘TN Rising’ from Thoothukudi on Monday, electronics manufacturing and renewable energy sectors are set to take centrestage.

Sources told businessline that South Tamil Nadu’s existing strengths in precision manufacturing and green energy, electronics and renewable energy investments are set to be the highlight of the TN Rising conclave at Thoothukudi. The Tuticorin port is also a huge draw for these manufacturing entities to set up export-oriented units, sources said.

Businessline has learnt that high precision electronics manufacturing firm Yeemak, along with its group company Jeanuvs proposes to invest around ₹3,500 crores in Thootukudi for manufacturing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and consumer electronics. This is set to be a large manufacturing set up with potential to employ over 7,000 people, sources in the know said.

Interestingly, the facility, once operational, will cater to both domestic and export market and is also set to dabble in defence manufacturing. “The company is also exploring ways to leverage the facility as an advanced integrated artillery ammunition and missile manufacturing factory,” an electronics industry insider said.

With the likes of Tata Power and Vikram Solar present in South Tamil Nadu, the region is also attracting renewable energy projects. This has also attracted Delhi-based Mobius Energy to set up a new ₹1,000 crore solar cell and module manufacturing facility in the district of Theni, with an MoU likely to be signed for it on Monday.

Beyond Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli, South Tamil Nadu is also seeing the mushrooming of more investment clusters. Dindigul and Theni’s agriculture strengths offer potential for companies in the value-added food exports space, and the temple town of Madurai too is fast emerging as an IT hardware and software hub.

Following Thoothukudi, the state also plans to conduct editions of the Regional Investment Conclaves in western, central, and northern Tamil Nadu.
