Nations Trust Bank (NTB) has received the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) approval for its previously announced acquisition of the Retail Banking operations of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sri Lanka (HSBC Sri Lanka).

In September this year, HSBC Sri Lanka signed a binding agreement to transfer its Retail Banking operations to NTB.

The acquisition would provide NTB with around 200,000 HSBC Sri Lanka customer accounts, including premium banking clients, retail loans and credit cards.

It is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

Upon closing, HSBC’s corporate and institutional banking operations in Sri Lanka will remain unchanged, continuing to serve international corporate clients and offering cross-border trade and investment services.

NTB said that the acquisition would strengthen its position in the premium retail banking segment and support its long-term growth objectives.

Nations Trust Bank director and CEO Hemantha Gunetilleke said “The approval from CBSL gives us the go-ahead to move forward with the acquisition process, which is currently progressing very well. We are now able to move into the next phase of the project with confidence.”

The sale of its retail banking business is part of HSBC Group’s simplification plan announced in October last year.

The decision follows a strategic review that determined divestment of the retail unit was the preferred course for the group and its stakeholders.

HSBC, at that time, said the reorganisation allows it to concentrate on areas where it has a competitive focus and growth prospects.

HSBC Sri Lanka CEO Mark Surgenor said: “Our priority during this period is to uphold the highest service levels for our customers and ensure that our colleagues are well supported during the transition into NTB.

“We are working closely with NTB towards a seamless transfer of banking services upon completion of the transaction.”

[TITLE]Fanatics lands retail and merchandising deal for 2026 FIFA World Cup:

Fanatics has struck a deal to run retail and merchandising for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the company announced Thursday.

The global competition will see 104 matches played in 16 stadiums across the U.S., Canada and Mexico this coming summer.

"There is no larger sporting event in the entire world than the World Cup … we've been doing a lot of events; this is the biggest one we'll have done yet," said Andrew Low Ah Kee, CEO of Fanatics Commerce, the company's manufacturing and retail arm.

Over the last several years, Fanatics has overseen retail operations at international sporting events like MLB's Tokyo Series, the NFL's slate of international games, the NHL's Four Nations tournament and UEFA's Euro 2024 in Germany. Fanatics was also the retail partner of FIFA's Club World Cup tournament across the U.S. last summer.

As part of its deal with FIFA for the 2026 tournament, Fanatics will oversee the in-venue retail operations across all 16 locations, which are mostly NFL stadiums with seating capacity of more than 60,000 fans.

It will also have retail operations in the parking lot at each stadium, as well as a retail presence at each of FIFA's fan festival locations spread across the host cities. In total, Fanatics is forecasting it will have more than 2,000 point-of-sale locations during the tournament.

"In terms of the logistical complexity of it, it's very real, but I'm confident in our readiness," said Low Ah Kee, adding that Fanatics has already operated in all the venues where the tournament will be held.

While the length of the tournament – 39 days, to accommodate a larger field of 48 nations – could present another layer of complexity compared to one-off events or shorter tournaments, Low Ah Kee said the company is aiming to lean into the momentum that is built during a World Cup, capitalizing on matchups and moments that arise to create quick-strike products and other limited merchandise.

Fanatics has expanded its soccer-focused retail operations in recent years, and is a partner of MLS, a quarter of the Premier League clubs, and several of the biggest club teams across the world like PSG, Inter Milan and Juventus. It's also a partner to several national teams who will be competing, such as Argentina, England, France, Belgium and Germany.

Low Ah Kee said that Fanatics' existing relationships have helped the company better understand soccer fans. That means more fashion-forward products and, specifically, more scarves, Low Ah Kee said.

Fanatics is already in discussion with partners, manufacturers, brands and vendors to make sure that the product stays well stocked for what it expects to be an unprecedented sports retail moment.

"We think this could be a multiple of the biggest events that we've run historically," Low Ah Kee said, declining to share specific figures.

Fanatics' execution of the 2026 World Cup will also set the stage for another massive undertaking: The company will oversee retail operations for the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.

[TITLE]Optimism Prevails Among Brands and Buyers at FFANY and FSNYE During Footwear Market Week:
[TEXT]
The overall mood was upbeat at FFANY and FSNYE this week.

For the first time this year, U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs were not a major part of the conversation. With the framework for many agreements in place, trade concerns were relegated to the rearview mirror.

That change allowed all attendees and brands to focus primarily on their fall/winter 2026 collections as well as some spring fill-in product for warmer climates and intermediate deliveries.

Providing a boost to the optimism that prevailed this week were strong consumer buying patterns for footwear over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in the U.S. that included the BlackFriday/Cyber Monday shopping events.

From the new styles on view, it was evident that brands were knee-deep in their focus on bringing the right balance between creativity and value to their lines to excite both buyers and consumers alike.

While FFANY was held across multiple venues and showrooms across Manhattan, the main pop-up was at 1370 Avenue of the Americas in New York City.

“We experienced a record level of activity this market week, marking the busiest FFANY we have seen in many years,” said Sandi Mines, FFANY president and vice president of corporate engagement at the Footwear Distributors and Retailers Association.

This time around, the show also included some fresh names.

“The FFANY Pop Up welcomed a significant influx of new and prominent brands, including Stoke, Ecco, Greats, Camper and Oliver Cabell,” Mines said. “Buyer sentiment was upbeat, driven by product lines that felt significantly more exciting than in previous years. This excitement was centered on innovation, featuring more dynamic materials, new heights, fresh colors, and overall greater design creativity.”

Over at Footwear Show New York Expo (FSNYE) at the Park Lane New York, president and chief executive officer Phyllis Rein was also bullish. “We delivered a strong, high-energy show with a great vibe throughout the week,” Rein told FN. “Retailer attendance was outstanding.”

She noted that retailers like Belk, Bloomingdale’s, Anthropologie, Von Maur, Nordstrom, Shoe Carnival, Shopbop, Ross, TJX, Urban Outfitters, and many more all stopped by over the span of the week.

Rein added that the footwear industry is heading into 2026 with “real optimism as momentum builds around innovation, e-commerce growth, and consumers who care deeply

[TEXT]
Delivered Net Sales of $1.472 Billion, a 9% Increase Versus Prior Year, Exceeding Expectations

REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Victoria’s Secret & Co. (“VS&Co” or the “Company”) (NYSE: VSCO) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Hillary Super, VS&Co Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a standout third quarter, with outperformance on net sales and earnings per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Net sales increased 9% over last year, driven by strength across Victoria’s Secret, PINK and Beauty, and supported by momentum across channels and geographies. These outstanding results reflect disciplined execution of our Path to Potential strategy.

[TITLE]Square’s product chief on why AI is the next iPhone moment for the tech industry:
[TEXT]
Today, I’m talking with Willem Avé, who’s head of product at Square. You know Square — it was started by billionaire Jack Dorsey, of Twitter fame, more than 15 years ago, and it got big on the back of that little magnetic reader that plugged into the headphone jack of the iPhone and let small businesses accept credit cards.

Now, of course, Square is more than a credit card reader, and sadly, the headphone jack is ancient history. Square itself is part of a parent company called Block, which is made up of a really interesting mix of financial services like Cash App, the digital wallet and payment platform, Buy Now Pay Later service Afterpay, and quite a few other subsidiaries. Block also owns a majority stake in the music streaming service Tidal, for reasons that are still a little opaque.

And that’s where this episode becomes pure Decoder bait right from the jump: as you’ll hear Willem explain, Block just restructured the entire company last year into a functional organization, so that it shares resources across all of its units. For Square, that means it’s sharing engineering resources with Tidal, a company that makes an entirely different product serving an entirely different industry.

[TITLE]Target’s New Style Concept Store Hits SoHo:
[TEXT]
Target Corp. is making a style statement in SoHo — zeroing in on fashion as it looks to get its design mojo back.

The mass merchant has remodeled its store at 600 Broadway in New York, transforming what was a typical grab-and-go location with a tight edit of its women’s apparel assortment, a sharper beauty offering and a radically different approach to presentation.

Shoppers enter the 26,000-square-foot store into a round tunnel-like corridor, a journey into the bull’s eye. The Target red is everywhere, but looks more muted and refined on the formed fiberglass foam walls.

Fashion is the star at the entrance, but jackets and holiday sweaters and party dresses are interspersed with complementary offerings from across Target’s gigantic offering, including candles, pillows, sparkling grape juice and stocking stuffers.

[TITLE]Suzy Amis Cameron’s Inside Out Grows With Research-led Design and Strategic Acquisitions:
[TEXT]
PARIS — If you’ve followed Suzy Amis Cameron’s work as an early pioneer in sustainable fashion, you know her journey began with Red Carpet Green Dress, the campaign that put eco-conscious design on the map, proving that elegance and ethics could coexist.

But RCGD had limits — it gained attention, but it couldn’t scale the systemic change Amis Cameron wanted.

“Certainly, Red Carpet Green Dress started a big conversation, but it wasn’t making huge impact. I was at this place in my life where I was like, something has to be done, and if there’s a way for me to do that, I will,” she told WWD.

That’s why she closed that chapter in March 2024 and founded the international holding company Inside Out.

[TITLE]Globacom boosts broadband capacity with new network investme:
[TEXT]
Globacom has announced a major expansion of its network infrastructure, following the acquisition of additional spectrum and data resources designed to enhance broadband speeds, widen coverage, and eliminate congestion nationwide.

The upgrades, activated on Thursday, 4 December, form part of the company’s ongoing strategy to build a future-ready communications network capable of supporting Nigeria’s growing digital economy, the operator said on Monday. According to the operator, the new spectrum significantly strengthens nationwide broadband performance, allowing for faster downloads, improved uploads, seamless video streaming, and clearer voice calls, even during peak usage hours.

In addition to the spectrum acquisition, Globacom is reinforcing its physical infrastructure.

Thousands of LTE sites installed this year are being upgraded, with hundreds of new sites currently under construction. The company plans to roll out thousands more sites over the next twelve months to deepen connectivity in both urban and rural areas.

Commenting on the ongoing upgrades, a company representative stated, “These new network resources are not isolated improvements; they represent a nationwide transformation. Nigerians will now experience stronger coverage, higher speeds and consistent service quality everywhere they live, work or travel.”

The operator further announced a strengthened fibre backbone across critical national routes to support the expanded network capacity. By reinforcing long-haul and metro links, Glo is enhancing data transportation at the core of its network, thereby improving overall reliability. This fibre enhancement is supported by upgrades to backhaul systems, including advanced microwave technology and core network optimisation. According to the company, these improvements will help eliminate congestion nationwide, resulting in more stable browsing, enhanced voice clarity and smoother digital experiences for millions of users.

Alongside its technical expansion, Glo is deepening its commitment to sustainability with the rollout of hybrid battery power systems across numerous sites. The greener model reduces dependence on diesel while also improving network uptime and cost efficiency.

Reaffirming its customer-focused direction, another senior official of the company stated, “Our promise is straightforward: world-class connectivity at pocket-friendly prices. Every Nigerian should have access to fast, reliable and affordable communication, and our network upgrade ensures exactly that.”

Globacom emphasised that customers will continue to enjoy affordable data and voice tariffs, loyalty rewards, special youth and SME packages, as well as exclusive entertainment offerings on GloTV. The company encouraged subscribers and potential customers to take advantage of the enhanced service capabilities, noting that the upgraded network will empower education, business operations, entertainment, e-commerce and digital innovation nationwide. With stronger spectrum capacity, broader coverage, faster speeds and nationwide congestion resolution, Glo affirmed that the new improvements mark the beginning of a more advanced digital experience for Nigeria.

[TITLE]Kite Realty Group Completes $474 Million in Dispositions and $86.1 Million of Additional Share Repurchases:
[TEXT]
INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kite Realty Group (NYSE: KRG), a premier owner and operator of high-quality, open-air grocery-anchored centers and vibrant mixed-use assets, today announced that the Company closed on the disposition of a portfolio that includes eight large-format power and community centers for gross proceeds of $429.0 million.

Large-Format Power and Community Centers List:

Property Center Classification MSA Total Owned GLA Belle Isle Station Power Oklahoma City 196,158 Central Texas Marketplace Power Waco 429,653 International Speedway Square Power Daytona Beach 240,251 Pavilion at King’s Grant Power Charlotte 303,212 Peoria Crossing Power Phoenix 238,004 Portofino Shopping Center Power Houston 370,196 Shops at Park Place Community Dallas / Fort Worth 137,605 Watauga Pavilion Power Dallas / Fort Worth 205,643 2,120,722

Additionally, on November 20, 2025, the Company closed on the sale of Paradise Valley Marketplace (Phoenix MSA) for gross proceeds of $45.0 million.

The proceeds from these dispositions are expected to be allocated to a combination of 1031 acquisitions, additional share repurchases, debt reduction, and a potential special dividend. The Company has repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock since the third quarter earnings call held on October 30, 2025, at a volume-weighted average price of $22.49 per share, for $86.1 million. Year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 7.2 million shares of common stock, at a volume-weighted average price of $22.42 per share, for $161.1 million, which represents a 21.5% discount to consensus net asset value per share, as of December 5, 2025.

“The sale of the larger-format assets is a decisive step in advancing our long-term portfolio strategy of improving our embedded growth profile, reducing exposure to at-risk tenancy, and strengthening the durability and resilience of our cash flows,” said John A. Kite, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The blended cap rate on these transactions is below the implied yield at which our stock currently trades, presenting a clear and compelling arbitrage opportunity to repurchase shares. We will continue to evaluate market conditions as we deploy the remaining proceeds, and we remain firmly committed to mitigating the earnings impact and maintaining net debt to EBITDA in the low-to-mid 5.0x range.”

Please note the following implications associated with these dispositions:

Our 2025 NAREIT and Core FFO per share guidance remains unchanged; and

Due to the change in the composition of the Same Property pool, our 2025 Same Property Net Operating Income growth assumption increases by 30 basis points at the midpoint, to a range of 2.6% to 3.0%.

[TITLE]Aterian Announces Exploration of Strategic Alternatives to Maximize Shareholder Value:
[TEXT]
SUMMIT, N.J., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aterian, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATER), a consumer products company, today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the initiation of a formal process to evaluate and explore strategic alternatives aimed at maximizing shareholder value. These strategic alternatives could include, among other things, a potential sale of assets of the Company, a sale of the Company, a business combination, a merger or other strategic action.

There can be no assurances regarding any specific outcome or transaction resulting from this strategic review. The Company has not established a timetable for completion of the review and does not intend to provide additional updates unless and until it determines further disclosure is appropriate or required.

“We own a portfolio of well-respected and differentiated consumer brands, have established a global omni-channel sales presence, and recently launched new products focused on higher margin, tariff-protected consumables. Yet despite these strengths, we believe our current market valuation simply does not reflect the sum-of-the-parts value of our brand portfolio. While we have successfully navigated a volatile environment, business and category challenges remain, and this reality dictates that we explore all relevant avenues to maximize shareholder value. We are approaching this review thoughtfully and with an open mind, and remain focused on delivering the highest-level customer and partner service throughout the process,” said Arturo Rodriguez, Chief Executive Officer.

The Company has engaged A.G.P / Alliance Global Partners to assist in exploring strategic alternatives for the Company. Paul Hastings LLP is serving as legal counsel for this strategic review.
