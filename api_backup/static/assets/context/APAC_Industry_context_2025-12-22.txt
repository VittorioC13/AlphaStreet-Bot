Not long ago, Hong Kong's share-sale market was a symbol of China's slowdown: Deal books were thin, investor sentiment was sour and bankers were fleeing the industry. This year, the script has flipped.Share sales nearly quadrupled to more than $73 billion through initial public offerings, placements and block trades. For the first time since 2013, that made Hong Kong the No. 1 fundraising spot in Asia, ranking just behind the US globally. The city has been at the front of a dealmaking boom across the continent that included a record year for IPOs in India, and strong markets in mainland China and Japan.In Hong Kong, Chinese companies fuelled the frenzy with gargantuan deals to power their global expansion plans. Battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology raised $5.3 billion in the world's second-largest listing in May. Electric-vehicle maker BYD Co. and EV-to-smartphones giant Xiaomi Corp. also raised more than $5 billion each in share placements. Deals even powered ahead as the US rolled out tariffs, and some faced pushback from US politicians."This year has exceeded expectations," said James Wang, head of equity capital markets for Asia excluding Japan at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. "We expect volumes to continue rising, albeit at a more measured pace."The upswing has been broad-based across Asia. Four of the world's five largest share-sale venues are in the continent, with India, mainland China and Japan trailing Hong Kong. For the first time, four Asian markets were among the top five in the world for share sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The Hong Kong IPO pipeline looks healthy as well, with

[TITLE]US$20bil photonic AI manufacturing city to be built in Nilai, says Aminuddin:
[TEXT]
SEREMBAN: An advanced photonic AI manufacturing city will be developed on a 1,200ha area in Nilai near here, says Datuk Seri Aminuddin Harun.

The Mentri Besar said the project, touted to be the first large-scale photonic computing and semiconductor initiative of its kind in the world, would involve an investment of some US$20bil over a five-year period.

"This will be one of the first large-scale photonic semiconductor manufacturing hubs in South- East Asia, and among the first globally, establishing Negri Sembilan as a leader in the future of advanced manufacturing.

"It is expected to deliver major benefits such as 40,000 high-paying skilled jobs, 20,000 indirect jobs across supporting industries and with a total of 60,000 long-term employment opportunities," he said in a statement.

Aminuddin said the project, which would position Malaysia at the forefront of the next global computing era, was a collaboration between Mehamood Hosein, founder of the Hosein Family Office, a United States-based deep-technology office and Gan Family Office led by Tan Sri Gan Kong Seng.

Gan is also Nilai Resources Group Bhd chairman.

"The Hosein Family Office brings the core photonic AI compute platform, long-term engineering and architectural leadership, engagement with international institutional investors and a development vision planned at a scale of approximately US$20bil over five years.

"Tan Sri Gan and his family office are contributing 1,200ha of prime land in Nilai, construction leadership and integrated infrastructure development and master planning for a world-class technology and industrial city.

"This ensures the Nilai Advanced Photonic AI Manufacturing City is developed on strong Malaysian foundations and built to international standards," he said, adding that the partnership will lead to Malaysia receiving world-class technology and global investment engagement to establish a sovereign photonic AI manufacturing capability.

Aminuddin said the development would include photonic chipset integration facilities, glass interposer and waveguide factories, AI compute system assembly lines, a national real-time AI and digital twin research centre, a deep-tech engineering and technology training academy and a modern integrated township to support industry and workforce growth.

"Photonic architecture is widely regarded as the next platform for semiconductor technology for the future, providing the performance, scale, and efficiency required to support advanced AI, national digital infrastructure, and next-generation industrial systems.

"This positions Malaysia among the first nations to build the semiconductor platform of the future," he added.

He added that the development will also position Malaysia as one of the few nations capable of producing the next generation of high-performance AI compute systems that will power future economies.

Asian shares were moderately higher and U.S. futures were mixed after the Bank of Japan raised its key policy rate Friday to its highest level in 30 years and U.S. inflation cooled more than expected.

The 0.25 percentage point increase by the BOJ was widely expected. It took the benchmark rate to 0.75%, the highest since 1995, but still low compared with other major economies.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 gained 1% to 49,507.21, leading the rise across Asia's key markets.

Following the BOJ's decision, Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield surpassed the 2% mark for the first time since May 2006. The U.S. dollar rose to 156.36 Japanese yen from 155.53 yen.

Global investors had been bracing for reactions to the BOJ's move, but markets appeared to take the decision in stride. The future for the S & P 500 rose 0.1%, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2%.

“The Bank of Japan’s decision to raise interest rates at its meeting today was clearly signaled ahead of time and therefore came as no surprise,” Abhijit Surya of Capital Economics said in a report, noting that “financial markets had almost fully priced in a hike ahead of today’s meeting.”

Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng rose 0.8% to 25,713.56, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.4% to 3,890.43.

In Seoul, the Kospi climbed 0.7% to 4,020.55.

Asia’s share gains were also built on optimism over more Fed rate cuts, after the U.S. on Thursday reported a lower-than-expected 2.7% rise in inflation for November, leaving potentially more room for the Fed to cut rates as the U.S. job market slows.

On Thursday, European indexes gained after the Bank of England cut its key interest rate and the European Central Bank kept its rate steady.

But Thursday’s U.S. inflation update may also not move the needle that much at the Fed given how noisy economic reports have been following the 43-day U.S. government’s shutdown. The inflation report was delayed eight days by the shutdown, which also prevented the Labor Department from compiling overall numbers for consumer prices and core inflation in October.

The next monthly update on inflation, for December, could provide a better gauge of what’s actually happening.

In the U.S. on Thursday, the S & P 500 edged up 0.8% following a four-day losing streak to 6774.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 65.88 to 47,951.85, and the Nasdaq composite rose 313.04 to 23,006.36.

Technology stocks helped lift the U.S. stock market. Micron Technology, a key maker of memory chips, jumped 10.2% on stronger-than-expected profit and revenue for the latest quarter ending November as the company also delivered an upbeat forecast for upcoming revenue and profit.

But investor concerns over an overblown AI bubble are still clouding the prospects of some companies which benefited big from the AI boom. Broadcom and Oracle’s shares had fallen significantly since last week. Oracle’s shares rose 0.9% on Thursday, while Broadcom’s added 1.1%.

Nvidia, the chip company that’s become Wall Street’s most influential because of its immense size, gained 1.8%.

Another winner was Trump Media & Technology Group, which jumped 41.9% to trim some of its steep loss for the year so far, 69.3% coming into the day. The company, which began with President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform and then moved into cryptocurrencies and various other lines of business, is now moving into nuclear power.

It’s merging with TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal, and each company will own roughly half of the combined business.

In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 16 cents to $55.84 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 21 cents to $59.61 per barrel.

The euro slipped to $1.1715 from $1.1724.

The price of bitcoin rose 3.8% to about $88,000.

[TITLE]Hong Kong stocks tread water as tech giants stumble on AI bubble jitters:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong stocks traded sideways on Thursday, with technology stocks retreating on growing anxiety that a global boom in artificial intelligence could turn into a bubble.

The Hang Seng Index edged up 0.1 per cent to 25,498.13 at the close. The Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 0.7 per cent. On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index slid 0.6 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 per cent.

Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone and electric vehicle maker, tumbled 2.5 per cent to HK$40.20 and Pop Mart International Group, maker of blockbuster plush toy Labubu, shed 1.3 per cent to HK$193.20 on concerns

Indian stocks traded lower on Thursday, with the Sensex and Nifty extending losses to a fourth consecutive session as uncertainty over a potential U.S.-India trade agreement continued to weigh on investor risk appetite.
