[TITLE]Penn State set to begin 'transformational' apparel deal with adidas:
[TEXT]
AI-assisted summary Penn State announced a 10-year partnership with adidas, ending its relationship with Nike.

The new deal will begin on July 1, 2026, and will outfit all 31 varsity sports programs.

Reports suggest the "transformational" agreement could be worth as much as $300 million.

Penn State is becoming an adidas school, after all.

University officials announced a "transformational" 10-year deal with adidas Friday as its official uniform, footwear and apparel partner − ending their more than three-decades relationship with Nike. The new deal begins July 1, 2026, the first day of Penn State's fiscal year.

Though Penn State did not release financial details, reports, like this one from the Centre Daily Times, say it could be worth as much as $300 million. Adidas will outfit each of Penn State's varsity athletic programs as well as produce merchandise for sale.

"Today, we step into a bold new era," is how Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft described the deal in a university news release.

"This partnership goes far beyond uniforms, it is unlike anything else in the marketplace. Adidas is making an unprecedented commitment to Penn State: delivering record investment in our department, groundbreaking NIL and marketing opportunities and access to technology and innovation that no other program can match.

"This agreement sets a new industry standard ..."

Penn State and adidas "will be prioritizing high-impact NIL agreements and brand marketing campaigns" for athletes in each of its 31 varsity sports, according to the release.

Earlier this summer, adidas continued its push deeper into the college apparel market by signing with the Tennessee Volunteers.

"We see this new agreement as a unique opportunity for us to help shape the next chapter of Penn State athletics while staying true to everything that makes the Nittany Lions an iconic brand," adidas president John Miller said in the release.

Of course, the impending apparel shift will be a dramatic change for many Penn State fans, who have been buying PSU Nike sports gear designs for more than 30 years.

It's also the latest in a growing line of significant athletic department moves since Kraft took over three years ago. They include hiring the first outside food vendor for PSU athletic venues (Oak View Group), replacing the university's media rights partner (PlayFly over Learfield) and starting an athletic department content subscription service (ROAR+).

Kraft, of course, also is overseeing the ongoing $700 million Beaver Stadium renovations.

Penn State agreed to a $50 million field-naming rights change − West Shore Home at Beaver Stadium − to help fund the project.

[TITLE]Ja'Marr Chase ditches Nike for Kevin Hart-led apparel brand: What to know about the Bengals WR's deal with Fabletics:
[TEXT]
Only a few days before the Cincinnati Bengals' season opener against the Cleveland Browns, one of their superstars made a major change.

On Thursday, it was announced that receiver Ja'Marr Chase is leaving Nike to sign with Fabletics, an apparel brand that has Kevin Hart as an investor and the face of its menswear line. According to Jordan Schultz, Chase becomes the first NFL star Fabletics has ever signed.

Sources: #Bengals superstar WR Ja'Marr Chase is making a bold move — leaving Nike to sign with Fabletics, the apparel brand Kevin Hart invested in.

One of the NFL's biggest stars teaming up with one of entertainment's biggest names, Chase will be the first NFL star Fabletics has… pic.twitter.com/FHDuPoRXrc — Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) September 4, 2025

In 2024, Chase won the NFL receiving "triple crown," leading the league in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. The 25-year-old had an incredible season with 127 receptions for 1,708 yards and seven touchdowns. He is only the sixth player in the Super Bowl era to accomplish this feat; Cooper Kupp was the last to do it in 2021, and before that, Steve Smith Sr. in 2005.

Chase is currently the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL, with an average annual salary of $40.25 million. The Bengals enter the season with high expectations, especially after giving him, Tee Higgins and Trey Hendrickson new contracts.

[TITLE]Nike’s P-6000 Sneaker Will Be Your Best Fall Investment for Retro-Inspired Style and Everyday Comfort:

We said what we said: 2025 is the year of the retro Nike sneaker, confirming fashion insiders’ quest for hearty doses of nostalgia when it comes to what they’re putting on their feet this fall. But it doesn’t take a thorough examination of the iconic brand’s “New & Featured” section to get a firmer understanding of the Y2K-inspired sneakers style-savvy shoppers are gravitating to these days; instead, a trip down memory lane (precisely six years back) to the release of the Nike P-6000 style in particular is the first step to grasping how and why it became one of the leading retro runners of the year.

Taking on the best traits of Nike’s early aughts releases — specifically the Pegasus 2006 and Pegasus 25 — it’s not exactly the kind of low-profile, slim-fit sneaker that’s been gracing the street styles of everyone from Jennifer Lawrence to Gigi Hadid as of late. The Nike P-6000 is a chunky dad shoe through and through, but there’s nothing grandfatherly

[TITLE]Mary Dillon Out as Dick’s Sporting Goods Closes $2.4 Billion Foot Locker Deal:
[TEXT]
Dick’s Sporting Goods and are officially one company.

On Monday, Dick’s announced it had completed the $2.4 billion acquisition of . As a combined company, Dick’s will now operate more than 3,200 stores plus e-commerce and digital businesses across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, plus a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

The transaction is expected to deliver between $100 million to $125 million in cost synergies in the medium term, primarily through procurement and direct sourcing efficiencies, and Dick’s anticipates the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in fiscal year 2026.

But the company did add on Monday that it will continue to operate Foot Locker’s portfolio of brands, including Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and Atmos, under an new leadership team.

As such, Dick’s executive chairman, Ed Stack, will lead the global Foot Locker businesses, in partnership with two new presidents, one for North America and one for international.

For North America, Dick’s has named former longtime Nike executive Ann Freeman as president of the North America. Freeman spent 26 years at the Swoosh, with her most recent role served being vice president and general manager of North America.

The executive pick is a bit controversial given Freeman’s past at Nike. In 2021, Freeman, previously known as Ann Herbert, resigned from her role at Nike a few days after Bloomberg Businessweek released a cover story featuring Hebert’s then 19-year-old son, Joe, who ran a sneaker resale business called West Coast Streetwear. Joe’s experience building the company was detailed in the piece, which examined how young entrepreneurs are capitalizing on the resale boom.

The story discovered that Joe was reselling shoes that were being purchased, in some cases, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, with Ann’s American Express corporate card. Some of the shoes being resold were purchased at Nike’s employee store in Beaverton, Ore., and at other Nike stores using the family discount, according to the story.

But since this controversy, Freeman has gone on to serve on Allbirds’ board of directors since 2022.

In a statement on Monday, Freeman said that she is “thrilled” to join and lead Foot Locker North America at a “transformative” moment.

“Together, we have an extraordinary opportunity to build on Foot Locker’s rich heritage and deliver innovative experiences to a variety of footwear consumers – from athletes to sneaker enthusiasts and everyone in between,” Freeman said. “I look forward to working with the talented Foot Locker team as we accelerate growth, enrich our brand partnerships and inspire the next generation of consumers.”

Freeman will be supported by a Foot Locker management team of experienced senior leaders. This includes Tony Aversa, who will serve as senior vice president and general manager of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker North America. Denise Karkos will serve as senior vice president and general manager of Champs Sports. George Jenkins is now senior vice president of store operations and customer experience at Foot Locker North America.

Peter Scaturro is now senior vice president and chief financial officer of Foot Locker North America. Steve Miller is now senior vice president and chief operating officer of Foot Locker North America. Brett O’Brien is senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Foot Locker North America. And Michael Keinath is senior vice president and chief people officer of Foot Locker North America.

As for its international business, Dick’s said it has yet to officially name a president for the division.

With these moves Mary Dillon, chief executive officer of Foot Locker, and Franklin Bracken, president of Foot Locker, have exited the company.

“We are very enthusiastic about the future of Foot Locker,” Stack said in a statement. “The world class team we have assembled is committed to returning Foot Locker to its rightful place in our industry. We are committed to investing in and growing Foot Locker through its strong culture, led by the Stripers, and creating a more powerful experience for consumers.”

Lauren Hobart, president and chief executive officer of Dick’s added that she is “excited to welcome the Foot Locker team into the company.

“Bringing together the strengths of both companies will help us return Foot Locker to growth while continuing to fuel Dick’s momentum,” Hobart said. “As a combined company, Dick’s and Foot Locker will create a global platform that will redefine the sports retail industry and unlock value for both companies, our brand partners, our teammates, our communities and our shareholders.”
