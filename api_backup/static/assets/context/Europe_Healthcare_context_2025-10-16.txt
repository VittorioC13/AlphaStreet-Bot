RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. and BOSTON, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: BCRX) and Astria Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXS) today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which BioCryst has agreed to acquire Astria, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing therapies for allergic and immunologic diseases, for a mix of cash and stock representing an implied value of $13.00 per Astria share, and approximately $700 million in enterprise value. The transaction was unanimously approved by both the BioCryst and Astria Boards of Directors. Upon closing of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of 2026 subject to customary closing conditions, Jill C. Milne, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Astria Therapeutics, will join the BioCryst board of directors.

Astria’s lead product candidate navenibart is an injectable, long-acting, monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein for hereditary angioedema (HAE) prophylaxis. Navenibart’s potentially best-in-class clinical profile and highly differentiated every 3- and 6-month administration schedule could offer significant improvements over existing injectable options and address key unmet needs in the HAE patient community.

BioCryst’s established commercialization infrastructure and deep expertise in HAE are expected to maximize the reach of navenibart, expanding access for patients. With the addition of navenibart, BioCryst’s portfolio will include both a leading oral and potentially best-in-class injectable therapy for HAE, empowering physicians and patients with optimal choices for individualized care.

Upon closing of the transaction, BioCryst will also obtain Astria’s early-stage program for atopic dermatitis, STAR-0310. BioCryst plans to seek strategic alternatives for this asset.

“We believe this transaction gives BioCryst a perfect second product candidate that fits seamlessly with our HAE core competency and enables us to build out a comprehensive portfolio that could offer the most patient-friendly option, regardless of administration preference,” said Jon Stonehouse, Chief Executive Officer of BioCryst. “Navenibart can emerge as the injectable of choice for patients seeking infrequent, pain-free dosing, strong attack control, and a mechanism of action they know and understand. With our leading product, Orladeyo, and navenibart’s potentially best-in-class profile, we will be well-positioned to drive sustainable growth and profitability while optimally serving the HAE patient community.”

“We are thrilled to have navenibart become an integral part of BioCryst’s HAE portfolio, advancing our shared mission of empowering patients to live beyond the limitations of their disease,” said Jill C. Milne, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Astria Therapeutics. “We have great confidence in BioCryst's proven expertise and ability to successfully bring navenibart to patients who need better options for managing HAE and improving their quality of life. Importantly, this transaction represents a compelling outcome for Astria stockholders, providing cash for their shares at closing as well as continued ownership of BioCryst. I am incredibly proud of our talented Astria team, whose dedication and hard work have brought us to this important milestone.”
