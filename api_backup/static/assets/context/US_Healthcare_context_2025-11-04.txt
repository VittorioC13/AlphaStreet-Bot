FDA moves to fast-track biosimilars, potentially lowering drug costs — but at what cost?

FDA proposes easing clinical trial requirements for biosimilars, allowing manufacturers to rely more on lab testing rather than costly human studies.

Biologic drugs account for 51 percent of U.S. drug spending despite making up only five percent of prescriptions, driving demand for cheaper alternatives.

New guidance could cut biosimilar development time in half, saving companies up to $100 million per drug.

Critics warn reduced testing may compromise safety, raising concerns

[TITLE]Effect of imeglimin on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes:
[TEXT]
Abstract Objective Preclinical studies, including animal and in vitro experiments, have suggested that imeglimin, a novel antidiabetic drug, may have beneficial effects on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, its effect on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether imeglimin has beneficial effects in individuals with type 2 diabetes and hepatic enzyme abnormalities. Methods This multicenter, retrospective, single-arm study included 49 individuals with type 2 diabetes who newly initiated imeglimin treatment and continued it for six months. Individuals with chronic liver diseases other than MASLD were excluded. Treatment efficacy for liver function was defined as an ALT reduction of ≥11 IU/L, corresponding to the upper interquartile range of ALT reduction. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of this treatment efficacy. Results Body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels significantly decreased after six months of imeglimin treatment. Additionally, both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels significantly decreased (ALT: 21.0 IU/L [13.0–39.0] vs. 17.0 [12.5–28.0], p = 0.002; AST: 21.0 IU/L [17.0–30.0] vs. 18.0 [16.0–26.0], p = 0.010, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ALT and AST levels were significant predictors of treatment efficacy for liver function, after adjusting for HbA1c and BMI levels (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.12, p = 0.006; OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06–1.23, p = 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for baseline ALT as a predictor demonstrated excellent discriminatory performance (Area under the curve: 0.905, p = 0.004). A cutoff value of 25 IU/L yielded 100% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity. Conclusion This exploratory study suggests that imeglimin may have beneficial effects in individuals with type 2 diabetes and elevated ALT (≥25 IU/L), potentially associated with MASLD. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Introduction Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly referred to as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is a growing global health concern [1]. MASLD is characterized by hepatic steatosis accompanied by at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, such as an elevated body mass index (BMI), increased waist circumference, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, or hypertension [2]. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) represents the inflammatory and fibrotic spectrum of MASLD and signifies a more severe progression of the underlying metabolic liver disease [1]. MASH is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease [1,3] and is increasingly acknowledged as a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the general population [1,4]. The Standards of Care in Diabetes—2025, issued by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend appropriate screening for MASLD in patients with type 2 diabetes to prevent future cirrhosis, HCC, liver transplantation, and all-cause mortality [5] Lifestyle interventions, such as dietary modifications and exercise, have been shown to improve MASLD [5,6]. Additionally, several pharmacological agents, including vitamin E, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and pioglitazone, have demonstrated efficacy in MASLD, and their use is supported by clinical evidence [5,6]. Nevertheless, given the multifactorial pathogenesis of MASLD, treatment responses are heterogeneous and many patients do not achieve sufficient improvement, indicating a continuing unmet need for additional therapeutic options. Imeglimin is a novel antidiabetic agent with a unique chemical structure that bears some resemblance to metformin. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that imeglimin improves both insulin resistance and insulin secretion. In addition, imeglimin has been reported to have a lower risk of lactic acidosis [7–11]. These features suggest that imeglimin exerts its antidiabetic effects through novel mechanisms of action, although these mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Beyond improving glycemic control, several animal studies have indicated that imeglimin may reduce hepatic fat accumulation in obese mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet [12,13]. Furthermore, imeglimin has been shown to attenuate inflammation and oxidative stress and to prevent hepatic fibrosis in non-diabetic mice with MASH induced by a choline-deficient, high-fat diet [14]. These findings raise the possibility that imeglimin could serve as a novel therapeutic option for MASLD in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, clinical evidence regarding the effects of imeglimin on liver function remains limited. This study aims to evaluate whether imeglimin has beneficial effects in individuals with type 2 diabetes and elevated liver enzyme levels.

Materials and methods Participants We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, single-arm observational study to examine the effect of imeglimin treatment on liver function in a real-world clinical setting among individuals with type 2 diabetes. A total of 49 individuals with type 2 diabetes receiving medical care at Kurume University Hospital, Social Insurance Tagawa Hospital, Yame General Hospital, and Chikugo City Hospital were recruited from December 2021 to April 2024. All participants were newly treated with imeglimin and continued treatment for six months. In accordance with recent consensus statements [15,16], MASLD is defined as hepatic steatosis in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors such as type 2 diabetes. Because hepatic steatosis could not be confirmed by imaging or histology in this study, we defined MASLD clinically as the presence of type 2 diabetes with elevated ALT (≥25 IU/L), alcohol consumption below the threshold for alcohol-related liver disease (<women: 350 mg/week, men: 420 mg/week), and the absence of other chronic liver diseases. Patients with viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, or primary biliary cholangitis were excluded based on medical history, laboratory data available in clinical records, and physician judgment. However, systematic serological testing for viral and autoimmune markers was not performed in all participants. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. This multi-center study was conducted under a single centralized approval granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Kurume University Hospital (approval no. 22034). All participating institutions relied on this central approval in accordance with their institutional policies; therefore, separate local approvals were not required. This study utilized data from the “Development and Analysis of a Diabetes Registry in Chikugo”, and eligible participants were identified by reviewing their medical records. Data were accessed for research purposes between May 2024 and December 2024. The authors had access to identifiable information during data collection; however, all data were anonymized prior to analysis. Data collection All data were retrospectively collected from medical records. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were measured using a standard high-performance liquid chromatography method and reported according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program. The Fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) index was calculated using the following formula: age (years) × aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (U/L)/ [platelet count (10⁹/L) × √alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (U/L)]. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg, or the current use of any antihypertensive medication. Hyperlipidemia was defined as a serum concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥120 mg/dL and triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL, in accordance with Japan Atherosclerosis Society criteria, or the current use of lipid-lowering agents. Macrovascular disease was defined as a history of acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris confirmed by clinically significant obstruction on coronary angiography, revascularization via angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, cerebral infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. Statistical analyses Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (25th-75th percentile), while categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages. Differences between groups were analyzed using the unpaired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. Changes in concomitant medication use between baseline and study completion were evaluated using Bowker’s test for paired categorical data. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of treatment efficacy, aiming to determine which populations benefit most from the treatment. Treatment efficacy for liver function was defined as an ALT reduction in the upper interquartile range (corresponding to an ALT reduction of ≥11 IU/L, S1 Fig). Statistical analyses were performed using JMP version 18.2.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Discussion Preclinical studies, including animal and in-vitro experiments, have suggested that imeglimin may exert beneficial effects on MASLD [12–14]. However, clinical evidence showing its effects on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes remains limited. In the present study, we demonstrated that the efficacy of imeglimin in improving liver function was significantly associated with baseline AST and ALT levels. ROC curve analysis identified a baseline ALT cutoff value of 25 IU/L as an excellent predictor of treatment response. Imeglimin significantly reduced both ALT and AST levels in individuals with ALT ≥ 25 IU/L, potentially indicative of MASLD, while no significant reduction was observed in those with ALT < 25 IU/L. Furthermore, a significantly reduction in the Fib-4 index was observed only in the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group. According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), ALT levels exceeding 30 IU/L may suggest the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [17]. In a biopsy-based study, Castera et al. demonstrated that men with ALT ≥ 30 IU/L and women with ALT ≥ 20 IU/L had a higher prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis [18]. Based on these findings, it is plausible that the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group in our study included individuals with hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or fibrosis, in whom imeglimin exerted beneficial effects. The pathogenesis of MASLD and MASH is complex and multifaceted. Only 5–10% of MASLD patients progress to MASH, while the majority (90–95%) present with simple steatosis, commonly referred to as fatty liver [19]. The widely accepted multiple-hit hypothesis implicates insulin resistance as the central mechanism, promoting hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and increasing circulating free fatty acids (FFA) via enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis [20]. These FFAs are taken up by the liver, contributing to triglyceride accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which further drive hepatic inflammation and injury [21]. Imeglimin has demonstrated multifaced hepatic effects in preclinical models. It ameliorated hepatic steatosis by enhancing fatty acid oxidation, stimulating glucagon secretion, and suppressing DNL, while also improving mitochondrial function [12,13]. Specifically, imeglimin partially inhibits mitochondrial Complex I and restores Complex III activity in hepatocytes, resulting in reduced ROS production and increased ATP levels [12]. These mitochondrial effects may contribute to the observed hepatoprotection, as ROS overproduction and ATP depletion are associated with hepatocyte injury [22]. Kaji et al. reported that imeglimin attenuated steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in a non-diabetic MASH mouse model induced by a choline-deficient, high-fat diet (CDA-HFD) [14]. Imeglimin increased hepatic expression of fatty acid oxidation markers, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), and decreased hepatic oxidative stress markers, including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA). It also suppressed hepatic macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while reducing fibrosis markers, including collagen type 1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and galectin-3 expression. These findings suggest that imeglimin may directly attenuate hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. In addition to these preclinical observations, recent clinical studies have also reported hepatic benefits of imeglimin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Uto et al. [23] demonstrated improvements in liver enzyme levels and elastography-based indices after six months of imeglimin therapy. Tanaka et al. [24] observed reductions in noninvasive fibrosis markers, including Fib-4 index and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), particularly among patients at higher baseline fibrosis risk. Furthermore, Fukunaga et al. [25] showed that imeglimin improved ALT, AST, and fibrosis-related indices such as FIB-4 and FAST score, although no significant changes were detected in liver fat content or stiffness. These findings are consistent with the present results, while our study extends prior work by demonstrating that improvements in ALT, AST and FIB-4 were confined to patients with elevated baseline ALT (≥25 IU/L), thereby highlighting the potential clinical utility of ALT as a simple marker for stratifying treatment response. In the present study, the observed reduction in ALT in the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group may reflect improvements in hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as suggested by both preclinical studies and recent clinical trials reporting decreases in Fib-4 following imeglimin therapy [24,25]. The Fib-4 index levels in this group decreased from 1.6 [1.0–2.1] to 1.4 [0.9–1.7], slightly above the normal range [5,26]. Although the Fib-4 index is useful noninvasive marker of liver fibrosis, its diagnostic performance is reportedly reduced in individuals with type 2 diabetes [27,28]. Thus, while our findings hint at a potential antifibrotic effect of imeglimin, further investigation is warranted to substantiate this. With regard to combination therapy, trends toward reduced ALT and AST levels were observed in individuals concurrently using SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, a statistically significant reduction was observed only in ALT levels among those using SGLT2 inhibitors. This limited significance may be due to the small sample size and does not exclude a possible synergistic effect, particularly in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists. The effect of imeglimin was also observed in the subgroup using SGLT2 inhibitors. While both agents have been associated with enhanced fatty acid oxidation, the underlying mechanisms appear to differ: imeglimin improves mitochondrial function and thereby facilitates more efficient fatty acid oxidation at the cellular level [12], whereas SGLT2 inhibitors induce a systemic substrate shift from glucose toward fatty acid and ketone body utilization through glucosuria-induced energy loss [29]. In addition, preclinical studies have suggested that both agents may attenuate hepatic inflammation and fibrosis through mitochondrial protection, oxidative stress reduction, or metabolic modulation [12,14,29], although the extent to which these effects overlap remains uncertain. Taken together, these findings suggest that the hepatic benefits of imeglimin under concomitant SGLT2 inhibition are mediated by complementary and at least partly independent mechanisms. Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to clarify these interactions more definitively. This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted as a one-arm, uncontrolled study, limiting our ability to ascribe causality to imeglimin. Second, although we used serum ALT as a representative marker of liver function to stratify patients, we recognize that ALT is only a surrogate marker and does not directly reflect hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or fibrosis. Objective assessment using imaging modalities such as MRI or ultrasonography would be required to confirm hepatic fat reduction. However, because this was a retrospective, real-world, multicenter analysis, standardized imaging data were unavailable. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted as statistical associations based on biochemical surrogates rather than direct evidence of histological or imaging-based improvement. In addition, the threshold of ALT reduction (≥11 IU/L) used to stratify treatment response was derived from the statistical distribution (upper interquartile range) rather than from an established clinical cutoff, and should be regarded as an exploratory criterion. Third, the small sample size and short duration reduce the generalizability of our findings. In addition, the possibility of regression to the mean cannot be completely excluded, as patients with higher baseline ALT levels are more likely to show a reduction. Nevertheless, elevated baseline values do not necessarily normalize spontaneously, and the significant decrease observed only in patients with high ALT suggests a clinically meaningful therapeutic effect of imeglimin. Fourth, although patients with viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and other chronic liver diseases were excluded based on medical history and available clinical data, systematic serological testing for viral and autoimmune markers was not performed in all participants. Moreover, HCC was not systematically ruled out in this cohort; although no participants had clinical or imaging findings suggestive of HCC in their records, the possibility of unrecognized subclinical liver disease, including HCC, cannot be completely excluded.

Conclusion This exploratory study suggests that imeglimin may improve liver enzyme levels and the Fib-4 index in individuals with type 2 diabetes who exhibit elevated ALT levels (≥ 25 IU/L), potentially indicating coexisting MASLD. These findings support the need for large-scale, randomized controlled trials to confirm the hepatic benefits of imeglimin and to clarify its role in MASLD treatment.

[TITLE]Corporate venture firms stepped in for drug startups during biotech funding pullback:
[TEXT]
The prolonged slowdown in biotechnology startup funding has given an opportunity for a specific set of investors to step in: corporate venture firms.

Data compiled by BioPharma Dive show that venture funds associated with Novo Holdings, Eli Lilly and Sanofi have been among the most active backers of privately held companies this year.

Novo Holdings, for example, has been involved in 18 private venture rounds in 2025, the most of any of the roughly two dozen firms tracked by BioPharma Dive. Eli Lilly and Sanofi Ventures also contributed to 13 apiece, respectively, putting them among the upper echelon in terms of deal activity.

Corporate venture activity surged in 2025 Number of rounds involving the most active venture firms tracked by BioPharma Dive

The numbers reflect the growing importance of corporate venture investors — which often operate under the umbrella of a pharmaceutical parent — to privately held biotech companies. These firms have been a well-known part of the biotech startup ecosystem over the last decade or so. Many pharmas have venture arms that fund early-stage life science companies, among them Pfizer, Novartis, Roche and Johnson & Johnson. But they’ve increasingly been investing earlier and more actively in recent years.

Unlike traditional biotech investors, corporate venture arms don’t rely on outside funding from limited partners to raise new bankrolls. Instead, they draw their capital from their parent corporations, a steadier source of cash that can allow them the freedom to adopt a long-term strategy rather than focus on quicker returns, investors interviewed by BioPharma Dive said.

Lilly and Novo Nordisk, for instance, have billions of dollars in newfound revenue due to the popularity of their GLP-1 medicines for obesity, giving them — and, in Novo’s case, its corporate parent Novo Holdings, which is the associated entity that invests in young companies — more cash to work with.

“There's a significant need for investors like Novo that are deeper-pocketed, that are longer-term focused to play a role in the space,” said Scott Beardsley, a managing partner at Novo Holdings. “Unfortunately, drug discovery and development hasn't gotten any cheaper. It's gotten more expensive, so the need for capital is more pervasive than ever.”

The presence of a corporate venture firm can also make young drug companies seem more appealing to other investors. A July report from Silicon Valley Bank found at least 70% of biopharma initial public offerings since 2022 have included at least one corporate venture investor, and all of those stock issuances raised at least $50 million.

Corporate venture firms also backed at least 60% of biotechs acquired during that time, data points that, taken together, are a sign that their presence might “increase the odds of a successful outcome,” the authors wrote.

“If you ask some of the VC stakeholders, or other investors that tend to syndicate with these partners, it can be seen as a sign of validation that pharma is in there and they are taking a look at the science and they like what they see, because these people are best in class at what they do,” said Ariana DaCruz, a senior vice president at Stifel’s Life Science and Healthcare Venture Banking group.

Corporate arms can also bring benefits to biotech startups that stretch beyond dollars, such as help making important new connections. Biotechs “see the value of relationships that align around shared interest in the science and are not solely based on financial opportunity,” said Brad Robling, the vice president of Lilly Ventures.

That kind of support has been more crucial during a multiyear pullback in biotech funding. IPOs have been harder for startups to complete, forcing investors to keep companies private for longer and be more judicious with their cash. Many startups have had difficulty raising further funding rounds, resulting in staff layoffs, programs cuts and, in some cases, shut downs.

Uncertainty surrounding drug regulation and pricing, as well as competitive threats from China’s fast-growing biotech ecosystem have added more recent challenges for young companies, too.

Amid that backdrop, corporate venture arms have gotten a bigger chance to participate. In 2022, Novo Holdings, Sanofi Ventures and Eli Lilly were involved in a total of 11 private funding rounds. This year, that total has already ballooned to 44, according to BioPharma Dive data. (The upswing in activity has made them the only three corporate entities meeting BioPharma Dive's target focus.)

The presence of a corporate venture investor is a “particularly attractive option when access to capital from traditional venture sources and the public markets is constrained,” Robling said.

For startups, the theoretical downside of that activity is the possibility that corporate venture interest is tightly tied to the whims of a pharmaceutical company. Some corporate venture arms have a “primarily strategic mandate,” DaCruz said, looking for technologies that fall in line with what their pharma owners have prioritized. Those that invest according to that mandate might be influenced by changes in leadership or corporate strategy, which could cause funding for projects no longer in favor to disappear without warning.

A look at the recent investments by Novo Holdings, Eli Lilly and Sanofi Ventures shows many are based in areas, like neurological and immune drug research, that their associated pharmaceutical companies favor. Still, the corporate investors interviewed by BioPhama Dive insist they have a broader directive, homing in on unmet medical needs and science likely to translate into real drug prospects.

“Our view is, at this moment in time, this is what biotechs need,” Jason Hafler, Sanofi Ventures’ managing partner, said in September. “They need funds and [corporate VCs] to step in and lead rounds or co-lead rounds.”

[TITLE]Medical value tourism to propel Kerala as global healthcare hub:
[TEXT]
Kerala is combining modern medicine and ayurveda to emerge as a global destination of medical value travel.

Addressing the inaugural session of the Kerala Health Tourism and Global Ayurveda Summit and Expo 2025, industry experts called for leveraging Kerala’s strength in modern medicine and ayurveda to promote the State as the most cost competitive and quality healthcare destination in South Asia.

Kerala Industries Minister P Rajeeve outlined the initiatives by the State Government to position Kerala as a premier global healthcare destination. He emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate Ayurveda with modern medicine and promote the state as a holistic wellness hub.

Union Minister of State for Ayush, Prataprao Jadhav, speaking online, lauded Kerala for its excellence in Ayurveda care and treatment infrastructure.

Sajikumar, Chairman, CII Global Ayurveda Summit, and Managing Director, Dhathri Ayurveda Pvt. Ltd, said Kerala’s Ayurveda economy is projected to reach ₹60,000 crore by 2031 from the current ₹15,000 crore. The sector is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and touch ₹5 lakh crore by 2047, aligning with the Vikisit Bharat vision.

Global capital

Kerala has the potential to become the global capital of Ayurveda-based healthcare, tourism, manufacturing, and research. “Ayurveda is no longer just a tradition—it has evolved into a globally validated, technology-enabled healthcare science,” he noted.

Highlighting the opportunities in the global wellness economy, Sajikumar pointed out that the sector is currently valued at $5.6 trillion. Medical value travel is projected to reach $97 billion by 2027, while wellness tourism is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2028.

Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary, Ministry of Ayush, praised Kerala’s pioneering role in Ayurveda, calling it a model for other Indian states. He stated that Ayurveda and traditional healthcare systems are on the cusp of major transformation, projected to contribute 5 per cent to India’s GDP by 2047, up from the current 1.1 per cent. Kotecha also revealed that the Indian Ayurveda economy is currently valued at $43 billion and that investment proposals worth $1.2 billion are already in the pipeline.

The Summit, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Kerala Chapter, in association with the Ministry of Ayush and the Government of Kerala, drew delegates from 16 countries.

Thomas John Muthoot, Chairman, CII Southern Region said South India has most robust healthcare facilities in the country. He listed the uniqueness of Kerala in wellness and modern healthcare and highlighted the world class facilities in states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and Telengana.

VKC Razak, Chairman, CII Kerala, underscored the strong role of healthcare and wellness in Kerala’s economy, calling the sector “one of its most resilient pillars”.

PM Warrier, Convenor, CII kerala Ayurveda panel and Managing Trustee of Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala, emphasised the need to promote Kerala as a single destination offering world-class healthcare that combines Ayurveda and modern medicine—an initiative that has begun to yield results through international collaborations and outreach programs.
