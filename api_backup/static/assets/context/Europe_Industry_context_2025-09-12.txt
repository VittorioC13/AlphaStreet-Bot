Blow for UK drugs sector as Merck scraps £1bn expansion

US pharmaceutical giant Merck is scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations, saying the government is not investing enough in the sector. The multi-national business, known as MSD in Europe, said it would move its life sciences research to the US and cut UK jobs, blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. One science industry expert told the BBC that, following Merck's decision, many major pharmaceutical companies could stop investing in the UK. A spokesperson for the government defended its investments in science and research, but acknowledged there was "more work to do".

Pharmaceutical companies have been refocusing on investing in the US following pressure from President Donald Trump, including threats of sky-high tariffs on drug imports. Merck had already begun construction on a site in London's King's Cross which was due to be completed by 2027, but said it no longer planned to occupy it. The company will also vacate its laboratories in the London Bioscience Innovation Centre and the Francis Crick Institute by the end of the year, which will lead to 125 job losses. A spokesperson for the drug company said the decision "reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments".

'Global uncertainty'

Speaking in the House of Commons, science minister Ian Murray said Merck's decision was "deeply disappointing" but that it was "a commercial decision for them". The company recently announced 125 job losses and $3bn (£2.2bn) per year cost cuts. Mr Murray said global economic pressures and the US trade policy had compounded its problems. He added that pharmaceutical companies were getting a lower proportion of NHS drugs spending due to the actions of previous Conservative and coalition governments. However, Conservative shadow science secretary Julia Lopez said the message from Merck bosses was "unsparing". "Simply put, the UK is not internationally competitive", she said. "The government must wake up, and do so now."

Drugs spending

Sir John Bell, emeritus regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, told the BBC's Today programme that he'd spoken to several bosses of major companies in the past six months, "and they're all in the same space, and that is, they're not going to do any more investing in the UK". One of the problems, he said, was the amount of money the NHS spends on medicines. "Ten years ago, we used to spend 15% of our healthcare spend on pharmaceuticals. Now it's 9%. The rest of the world, the OECD, are sitting between 14 and 20%," Sir John said. "The large companies do have to work in a system where they can sell their products, and if they can't sell their products here, they'll go and do their business somewhere else." Richard Torbett, head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said the decision was "an incredible blow". "We've really got to see it as a wake up call to try and understand what is driving companies to make these difficult decisions and what can we do to turn that round," he told the BBC's Wake Up To Money programme. "The lack of competitiveness of the UK is the big thing that's driven the decision," he added. "We've got systematic under-investment in the products that come out of the end of innovation."

MSD is the latest pharmaceutical company to abandon or reduce investment plans in the UK. In January, AstraZeneca walked away from plans to invest £450m in expanding a vaccine manufacturing plant in Merseyside earlier this year, blaming reduced government support. The UK boss of another pharmaceutical giant warned last month that NHS patients would lose access to cutting-edged treatments because Britain was "largely uninvestable". Norvartis's Johan Kahlstrom said the company had "already been unable to launch several medicines" in the country due to the "declining competitiveness" of the UK market. In 2023, AstraZeneca chose to build a new factory in the Republic of Ireland instead of the UK. The firm's boss said at the time it wanted to build the site in north-west England, but a "discouraging" tax rate meant it chose Dublin instead.

Industry sources told the BBC the sector had been attracting major funding in the hub around Kings Cross focused on the intersection between life sciences and AI. They pushed back on claims that the decision was linked to ongoing negotiations over drug prices, in which industry has been lobbying hard for the NHS to approve more and pay more for medicines. The current pricing regime was set and agreed to by drug companies in 2023 - less than 18 months ago.

Since then, pharmaceutical firms have come under pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for American customers and to invest more in the US - affecting their ability to invest elsewhere. In an August interview with CNBC, Trump suggested that tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported to the US could reach up to 250%. The threat followed an executive order signed by the president in May aimed at reducing drug prices for American consumers. Dr David Roblin, chief executive of London-based biotechnology company Relation Therapeutics, told the BBC the fundamentals that drove MSD to invest in the UK in the first place had not changed. "The academic environment in the UK continues to produce innovative ideas and people to run with those ideas, which attracts foreign investment," he said. "The environment to do research is still outstanding: we've got great academics, the NHS does provide a research platform, for example the UK Biobank is proving to be a real attractor for companies like mine," he said. What has changed, Dr Roblin said, was the political landscape in the US which big pharma has to respond to, "because the US remains the largest market for pharmaceuticals on earth," he added.

There are approximately 95 national bodies with responsibility for regulation, licensing, data collection or standards, the Government’s new competitiveness plan has disclosed.

The plan highlights that the impact of planning and regulatory delays on energy infrastructure delivery in Ireland has been significant (including applications for grid connection).

The plan also points to the slow pace of planning, permitting and licensing systems in the manufacturing sector.

The Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity was published on Wednesday by Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke. It was originally scheduled to be produced later in the Coalition’s term but was brought forward to address issues for Ireland’s export economy, raised by the imposition of tariffs by the US.

The plan proposes 85 actions across six key areas. A central component is a “step change” in the funding for innovation and collaboration with higher institutions.

Other big actions are the creation of new structures on artificial intelligence (AI), intellectual property (IP) and start-ups, the reduction of red tape and less delays caused by regulatory bodies and by the courts.

The report finds that delays remain a feature of the Irish legal system. It points to the fact that 300 cases are awaiting delivery of a decision in the superior courts, 50 of which have been waiting for more than 12 months.

The plan recommends the full implementation of the recommendations of a 2020 report on the administration of civil justice, chaired by former president of the High Court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly.

It also said the reforms of judicial review contained in the Planning and Development Bill 2024 should be quickly implemented, as they will reduce delays and legal costs.

The 125-page document highlights the “significant investment gap” between multinational companies and Irish SMEs in research, development and innovation (RD & I).

[TITLE]Big Oil Cuts Back as $60 Oil Bites:
[TEXT]
In their first-quarter financial reports this year, Big Oil majors signaled they were doing just fine in a $60-per-barrel oil environment. Spending plans were aggressive, there was no mention of job cuts, and production plans featured the word “growth”. Six months later, with the price of oil still hovering between $60 and $70, things are changing.

Oil jobs in the U.S. shale patch were falling at the fastest pace since 2022, when Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate went from over $100 per barrel to below $80 in a matter of six months. In absolute terms, the job loss was not that much of a big deal, standing at 1.7%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited by Bloomberg this week. But oil prices are down by 125 since the start of the year, the publication recalled, adding that things were only going to get worse because demand for oil was “tepid”.

ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, served a blow to the bullishly minded among oil market observers, saying also this week it would cut as much as a quarter of its global workforce. The company said reductions will occur across functions and geographies, with further details to be shared directly with staff through internal briefings. The job cuts are part of a reorganization drive aimed at making the company more efficient and its structure simpler. The move, however, was taken to mean Conoco was in trouble and doing the first thing oil companies do when they are in trouble: shedding jobs.

Reuters noted a job cut announcement of a similar scale made by Chevron in February this year. However, the suggestion that Chevron decided to slash a fifth of its workforce because of the oil price decline is a bit of a stretch. Chevron announced its job cuts plan early in the year when the price depression was just beginning. It also motivated it with the need to cut costs following its megadeal for the acquisition of Hess Corp.

That said, the company itself noted the challenging environment it was operating in, with CEO Mike Wirth describing the final quarter of 2024 by saying, “I’m not going to call it the perfect storm, but it was a quarter where there were a lot of things that all went in one direction, and it was a negative direction.”

Along with jobs, oil companies are also cutting spending. According to Reuters, 22 public oil companies in the United States, including Conoco, Diamondback Energy, and Occidental, but not the supermajors, had cut a combined $2 billion in spending, as reported in their statements for the second quarter of the year. “We've gone from ‘drill, baby, drill' to 'wait, baby wait’ here in the Permian,” Latigo Petroleum chief executive Kirk Edwards told Reuters. Edwards separately told the Financial Times that the job cuts in the shale patch were “a flashing red warning light for the entire US oil and gas industry.”

The warning light is flashing mostly because of demand projections and predictions of an oil glut. At the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference this week, a number of analysts said Brent crude was

[TITLE]Gold Just Signaled a Major “Tell” For What’s Coming…:
[TEXT]
Gold is signaling that the next inflationary storm is about to arrive.

In the last year, gold has done several remarkable things.

First and foremost, central banks have acquired so much gold that the precious metal now comprises a greater percentage of foreign reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years. What does it tell you that the entities that can literally print money at will are loading up on an inflation hedge?

Remember, we’re talking about global central banks, not just one single bank. And it’s not difficult to see why they’re loading up on gold. The precious metal has broken out against every major world currency.

The markets are SCREAMING that currency devaluation is underway. And again, this is as global phenomenon: gold has broken out against the U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen and even the Swiss Franc!

Which brings us to today…

After a surge like the one gold experienced in form the end of 2024 through the first quarter of 2025, it makes perfect sense for the precious metal to “take a breather.” In investing, nothing goes straight up or straight down. And gold has spent the last four months consolidating.

Not anymore.

Last week gold broke out of its four-month consolidation period to the upside. This is a major “tell” that suggests the next leg up is beginning right here and now.

Put simply, gold is telling us that the next inflationary storm is about to begin. Central banks are already firing up the printing presses and cutting interest rates: both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada have cut rates SEVEN times, the Bank of England has cut rates five times, and the Swiss National Bank has already cut rates to zero!

The time to prepare for what’s coming is NOW before it arrives.

On that note, we just published a Special Investment Report concerning FIVE secret investments you can use to make inflation pay you as it rips through the financial system in the months ahead.

The report is titled Survive the Inflationary Storm. And it explains in very simply terms how to make inflation PAY YOU.

[TITLE]Elliott says Kansai Electric can become more attractive by selling non-core assets:
[TEXT]
TOKYO, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott Management, a shareholder in Kansai Electric Power, said the Japanese utility could become a more attractive long-term investment by selling non-core assets and boosting profitability and shareholder returns.

Elliott has become one of the top three shareholders of Kansai Electric, Japan's biggest nuclear power operator by reactors online, with a stake of between 4% and 5%, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

In a statement issued from London on Wednesday, Elliott said it was looking forward to working with Kansai Electric's management and other key stakeholders to strengthen the company's core business.

"By increasing shareholder returns, unlocking capital from its non-core assets and improving profitability, we believe the company can enhance its funding flexibility for future growth and bolster its appeal as a long-term investment proposition," its statement said.

Elliott wants Kansai Electric to boost its dividend to 100 yen per share from 60 yen per share and increase share buybacks by selling non-core assets, according to the source familiar with the matter, who was not authorised to speak publicly.

Elliott has identified non-core assets at the company worth more than 2 trillion yen ($13.58 billion), including over 1 trillion yen of real estate as well as a stake in a construction firm, the source said.

Elliott's statement did not provide details on its stake in Kansai Electric or other specific proposals. Kansai Electric did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Elliott has been active in a push for Japanese companies to boost shareholder returns and corporate value, taking stakes in a range of companies including Tokyo Gas, Sumitomo Corp and Dai Nippon Printing.

Apart from the energy business, Kansai Electric has assets in IT and real estate, among others, but it is targeting nuclear power as its main source of near-to-mid-term earnings growth. It plans to keep its dividend per share this fiscal year flat at 60 yen, despite a forecast 30% drop in profits to 295 billion yen.

Blow for UK drugs sector as Merck scraps £1bn expansion

US pharmaceutical giant Merck is scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations, saying the government is not investing enough in the sector. The multi-national business, known as MSD in Europe, said it would move its life sciences research to the US and cut UK jobs, blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. One science industry expert told the BBC that, following Merck's decision, many major pharmaceutical companies could stop investing in the UK.

Merck blamed the move on a lack of investment in the industry by the UK - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP SPENCER PLATT

Merck, the US pharmaceutical group, said on Wednesday it has dropped plans to build a $1.4-billion research centre in Britain, blaming the country’s “lack of investment” in the sector and its drugs prices.

The company said in a statement it would not go through with the construction, which had been slated for the King’s Cross district in central north London.

The British government acknowledged the “concerning news” and was standing by to help Merck employees in the UK and others affected by the development, a spokesman told AFP.

Merck said it would no longer take possession of Belgrove House in King’s Cross, ditching a project that was to have engaged 800 workers over the next two years.

It said the decision stemmed from a company evaluation of its research capabilities “and reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments”.

It said it would also close down its activities in two London labs by the end of the year, leading to 125 job losses.

The Merck statement confirmed news first reported by The Financial Times. The daily quoted the company as saying: “Simply put, the UK is not internationally competitive.”

The British government spokesman told AFP that “the UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world, but we know there is more work to do.”

He said the government recognised that the decision would dismay Merck employees in the country, and it “stands ready to support those affected”.

Merck’s decision follows that of UK sectoral rival AstraZeneca to abandon plans to build a $540-million vaccine factory in Britain, in the Liverpool region, because of what it said were insufficient state incentives.

The world’s biggest pharmaceutical groups have this year come under pressure from US President Donald Trump to invest in America or see their production in other countries be hit with swingeing tariffs.

Scotland could fall behind in Europe's space race, MPs warn

PA Media Shetland's SaxaVord is the Scottish spaceport at the most advanced stage of development, say MPs

MPs have warned that Scotland is at risk of falling behind in the race to launch the first satellites from western Europe into Earth's orbit. Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee has urged the UK government to put more investment into the development of Scottish spaceports, including Saxavord in Shetland. Scotland is considered to be suitable for launches due to its position in the world's northern hemisphere, and access to the North Atlantic's "low-traffic" airspace. The UK government's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said it had invested £96m into the Scottish space sector, including money for Forres-based rockets manufacturer Orbex.

In 2021, the prime minister at the time, Boris Johnson, committed to launching a space rocket from the UK by the following year. So far, a rocket has not been successfully launched into orbit from the UK - or western Europe - according to the Scottish Affairs Committee's new report. The group of MPs said Scotland had the potential to be a global leader in terms of small satellite launches, but it added that investment was lacking. They said a site in Norway was now likely to beat Scotland to the first launch. The committee has called for increased financial support from the UK government, and for it to become a customer of domestic launch services.

'Launch revolution'

Committee chairwoman and Labour MP for Glasgow West, Patricia Ferguson, said: "Scotland has real potential to become a leader in space launch, which space ports such as SaxaVord in Shetland are well-placed to seize. "The economic benefits of this would be huge, but it's a time-sensitive opportunity we're in danger of missing." She added: "We're urging the UK government to commit to sustained financial backing of the sector, and move towards long-term, co-ordinated investment that can match the fantastic ambition and momentum demonstrated by the sector." DSIT said it was providing investment. A spokesperson said: "We are backing Scotland's exceptional potential to lead Europe's space launch revolution. "Their spaceport, innovative rocket manufacturers, and unrivalled geographical advantages positions Scotland at the forefront of the launch sector." They added: "We are supporting this vital sector through sustained investment that matches the scale of this opportunity and have invested £96m into the Scottish launch sector, including £20m into Forres-based Orbex earlier this year."
