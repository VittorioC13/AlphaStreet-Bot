[TITLE]JPMorgan Chase hires two senior bankers to bolster consumer and retail investment team:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase has hired two managing directors to strengthen its consumer and retail investment banking unit, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Friday.

Brian Esmond will join in Los Angeles from Centerview Partners. Bryan Fleming will be based in New York after leaving Bank of America, where he worked as a managing director in retail and consumer investment banking.

Both are expected to start later this year and will report to Jonathan Dunlop, Patrick Gallagher and Aaron Weisbrod, the memo said.

JPMorgan's investment banking fees rose 7% to $2.5 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, underpinned by a rise in mergers and acquisitions and debt underwriting.

The move was first reported by Bloomberg News.

Toni Roeller, executive vice president of store experience and design at Dick’s Sporting Goods, told FN in an interview at the new location that the company “could not pass up” have a store so close to Manhattan when the space at Newport Centre became available.

“This is our second urban location for House of Sport,” Roeller said. “We learned a lot from our first one at the Prudential Center in Boston and we will be taking out learnings from there and translating that at this store and beyond.”

Roeller added that she anticipates customers to commute to this store from all over the NYC area. “We’ve taken into account the fact that we anticipate a tremendous number of commuters to come visit the store,” the executive said. “Between light rail, ferry and subways, there are plenty of opportunities for commuters to access the store.”

In terms of shoes, the executive noted that there are 13,000 unique footwear SKUs across 7,200-square-feet at the Jersey City House of Sport location. An additional 4,000 footwear SKUs are set in the store’s House of Cleats area.

“Whether you’re a sneakerhead, runner or commuter this store has a very enticing selection of footwear,” Roeller added. “We expect our footwear offering to be a tremendous draw for consumers. We do feel like because of the breadth of the assortment, we offer a unique opportunity across footwear, apparel, and then certainly all things sport.”

As of September 22, 2025, Roeller noted that there are 26 House of Sport locations nationwide. The Jersey City location is one of approximately 16 House of Sport locations opening in 2025. The other new House of Sport locations opened so far this year are in Miami, Fla.; Dayton, Ohio; Polaris, Ohio; Baton Rouge, La.; Leawood, Kan.; and Dallas, Texas.

The company plans to have as many as 75 to 100 House of Sport locations by the end of fiscal year 2027, Roeller added.

Sales rose to $3.65 billion in Q2, up 5 percent from the $3.47 billion in the same period last year. Comparable-store sales were up 5 percent, beating estimates of 3.4 percent.

[TITLE]Target Circle Has Early Holiday Discounts On Crocs, Hey Dude, Converse:
[TEXT]
Target‘s giving its paid 360 members special perks — including early access to discounts on select apparel and shoes — for Circle Week to get them ready for Halloween and early holiday gift shopping.

Circle Week runs from Oct. 5 to Oct. 11. While all Circle members can enjoy the special offers for the week, perks just for its paid 360 rewards members include exclusive giveaways and only-at-Target product drops, among other surprises.

Circle specials include 30 percent off denim for adults, 30 percent off women’s sweatshirts and sweatpants and 20 percent off kids’ apparel. Early access deals include buy one, get one 50 percent off on women’s national-brand bras and bralettes.

For footwear, Converse shoes are discounted 20 percent. For the week, there will also be deals of the day on many national brands, including Apple and Champion. Shoes from Crocs and Hey Dude are among the items slated for daily deals, with prices starting at 40 percent off or more.

“Target Circle Week is more than just another sale,” Cara Sylvester, executive vice president and chief guest experience officer, said, adding that it’s also the kickoff to holiday shopping. She said the events gives shoppers the ability to “stock up for Halloween, start crossing holiday gifts off their lists and enjoy the season stress-free.”

Target Circle Week deals are available at nearly 2,000 Target stores nationwide, with shoppers also able to avail themselves to the discounters convenience services such as free Order Pickup and Drive Up, as well as same- and next-day delivery. The Target Circle loyalty program is free, while the paid Target Circle 360 members receive additional exclusive benefits that include early access to shop brand collaborations.

The discounter in August offered a 30 percent discount on select kids’ shoes for its back-to-school event. How holiday 2025 will shape up remains to be seen.

According to a PwC 2025 Holiday Outlook survey, the consultancy firm is projecting a 7 percent to 10 percent decline in year-over-year shoe purchases, likely due to potential stick shock as tariffs hike prices on shoes starting this fall. Tariff impact is expected to impact other holiday spend as well.

In general, PwC is expecting holiday spending to fall by 5 percent from 2024 levels, representing the first notable drop since 2020. Eighty-four percent of respondents said they expect to pull back their spending in the next six months, citing rising prices, new tariffs and higher cost of living as the key reasons.

The projected decline is not unexpected. Earlier this year, a survey from AlixPartners in partnership with the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America found that tariffs and shoe prices had parents considering either trade-down options or buying fewer pairs as they pondered their back-to-school purchases. AlixPartners noted in July that if consumers pulled forward their spend in anticipation of higher prices later on, that move could leave less available later in their holiday budget.

Separately, Walmart’s also getting into the early holiday shopping war.

[TITLE]Dick’s Brings Its Massive House of Sport Retail Concept to NYC Area:
[TEXT]
Dick’s Sporting Goods has opened the doors to its first House of Sport concept store in the New York City area.

Located inside the Newport Centre shopping mall in Jersey City, N.J., the 85,000-square-foot store is the retailer’s smallest House of Sport location, which are typically over 100,000-square-feet.

The new store features a range of footwear, apparel and accessories from national brands like Nike, Adidas, On, Ugg, Asics, Jordan, Under Armour, The North Face, Skims, FP Movement and the retailer’s private label brands like DSG, Calia and Vrst.

There are also in-store experiences including a climbing wall, multiple golf bays with TrackMan simulators, and a multi-sport cage that can be used for baseball, softball, lacrosse, soccer and field hockey.

Toni Roeller, executive vice president of store experience and design at Dick’s Sporting Goods, told FN in an interview at the new location that the company “could not pass up” have a store so close to Manhattan when the space at Newport Centre became available.

“This is our second urban location for House of Sport,” Roeller said. “We learned a lot from our first one at the Prudential Center in Boston and we will be taking out learnings from there and translating that at this store and beyond.”

Roeller added that she anticipates customers to commute to this store from all over the NYC area. “We’ve taken into account the fact that we anticipate a tremendous number of commuters to come visit the store,” the executive said. “Between light rail, ferry and subways, there are plenty of opportunities for commuters to access the store.”

In terms of shoes, the executive noted that there are 13,000 unique footwear SKUs across 7,200-square-feet at the Jersey City House of Sport location. An additional 4,000 footwear SKUs are set in the store’s House of Cleats area.

“Whether you’re a sneakerhead, runner or commuter this store has a very enticing selection of footwear,” Roeller added. “We expect our footwear offering to be a tremendous draw for consumers. We do feel like because of the breadth of the assortment, we offer a unique opportunity across footwear, apparel, and then certainly all things sport.”

As of September 22, 2025, Roeller noted that there are 26 House of Sport locations nationwide. The Jersey City location is one of approximately 16 House of Sport locations opening in 2025. The other new House of Sport locations opened so far this year are in Miami, Fla.; Dayton, Ohio; Polaris, Ohio; Baton Rouge, La.; Leawood, Kan.; and Dallas, Texas.

The other House of Sport locations set to open in 2025 will be in Durham, N.C.; Glendale, Ariz.; Mobile, Ala.; San Antonio, Texas; Charlottesville, Va.; Strongsville, Ohio; Freehold, N.J.; Brandon, Fla.; and Kennesaw, Ga.

The company plans to have as many as 75 to 100 House of Sport locations by the end of fiscal year 2027, Roeller added.

In August, the company reported net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 of $381 million, or $4.71 per share, compared with $362 million, or $4.37 per share, a year earlier.

Sales rose to $3.65 billion in Q2, up 5 percent from the $3.47 billion in the same period last year. Comparable-store sales were up 5 percent, beating estimates of 3.4 percent.

Earlier this month, Dick’s completed its $2.4 billion acquisition of Foot Locker. As a combined company, Dick’s will now operate more than 3,200 stores plus e-commerce and digital businesses across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, plus a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Amazon and Google are in the hot seat.

Both of the multitrillion-dollar companies are facing off on Monday with US government regulators in separate court battles that highlight Washington's intensified scrutiny of Big Tech.

In a Virginia federal court, Google is squaring off with the Department of Justice over potential fixes to its digital advertising business after a judge found the tech behemoth holds an illegal monopoly in certain online adtech markets.

On the other side of the country, Amazon is on trial in a Seattle federal court over the Federal Trade Commission's accusations that the e-commerce giant "knowingly duped" millions of consumers into Amazon Prime subscriptions.

The FTC's case against Amazon

The FTC's lawsuit, filed in 2023, stemmed from a Business Insider investigation that found Amazon was internally aware its users found the Prime cancellation process confusing, but its executives shelved proposals to fix it.

Jury selection in the FTC v. Amazon trial begins on Monday, and opening arguments are scheduled to start on Tuesday.

According to the FTC lawsuit, Amazon used deceptive user interface designs to fool users into getting and renewing their Amazon Prime subscriptions.

The manipulative design elements violated the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act, which was passed in 2010 to ensure online consumers have a clear understanding of what they pay for and do not face recurring charges without their consent, according to the government agency.

Up until the FTC filed its lawsuit, Amazon internally named its Prime cancellation process after a long, ancient Greek poem, the agency said.

"Fittingly, Amazon named that process "Iliad," which refers to Homer's epic about the long, arduous Trojan War," the FTC wrote in one filing. "Amazon designed the Iliad cancellation process ("Iliad Flow") to be labyrinthine."

Amazon has argued that so many people subscribe to Prime — about 3 in 4 Americans use it — simply because they value what it offers.

The case carries high stakes for Amazon, as well as for executives. Ahead of the trial, US District Judge John H. Chun ruled that two executives who oversaw the Prime cancellation process would be personally liable if the jury sides with the FTC.

Chun is also overseeing a separate high-profile antitrust case that the FTC — along with over a dozen states — brought against Amazon. That case, which accuses the company of being a monopoly that unfairly uses its platform to squeeze third-party sellers, is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026.

Representatives for the FTC declined to comment on the case.

An Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement, "The bottom line is that neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong — we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first."

DOJ wants to again force a Google breakup

Earlier this year, Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that Google maintains a digital ad market monopoly following a weekslong landmark trial in 2024.

The DOJ and 17 state attorneys general had brought an antitrust lawsuit against Google, arguing that the company used acquisitions and anticompetitive ad auction tactics to build an illegal monopoly of the digital ad market.

The judge said in a 115-page ruling that the DOJ and the states proved Google "willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets for open-web display advertising."

"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets," Brinkema wrote.

Now Google and the DOJ are back in court, beginning Monday, for the remedies phase of the trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks.

Brinkema could ultimately force a breakup of Google's adtech business, and that's exactly what the DOJ is after.

As part of its proposed fixes, the DOJ wants the judge to force the company to sell off its Google Ad Manager, a tool used by publishers and advertisers to buy and sell digital ads.

Google has vowed to appeal the judge's monopoly ruling.

"DOJ's proposed changes go far beyond the Court's liability decision and the law, and risk harming businesses across the country," Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president for regulatory affairs, said in a blog post ahead of the remedies trial.

"Breaking apart integrated tools would make it harder for publishers to monetize their content and more expensive for advertisers to reach new customers, disproportionately hurting the small businesses who choose to use Google's tools to grow," Mulholland wrote.

Representatives for Google declined to comment on the case on Monday. The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this month, a Washington, DC federal judge spared Google from a breakup after he ruled the company's online search business is a monopoly.

Google has said it will also appeal that ruling.
