Company Overview

Terrestrial Energy is a developer of Generation IV nuclear plants using proprietary Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) technology. IMSR technology captures the transformative operating benefits of molten salt reactor technology in a small modular plant design that represents true innovation in affordability, efficiency, and versatility of nuclear energy supply.

Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR plants will supply zero-carbon, clean, firm, low-cost, high-temperature industrial heat and/or electricity for a dual-use energy role. Industrial applications include data center power supply, industrial heat and power, grid power, and green fuels sectors. The Company’s IMSR plant design, consisting of two operating IMSRs, has an 822 MWth / 390 MWe capacity. Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR technology is differentiated from legacy nuclear technology through its use of molten salt reactor design, delivering superior efficiency and inherently safe operation.

Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR plants are designed to utilize low-cost, readily available Standard-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (SALEU) fuel enriched to contain less than 5% of uranium-235, providing access to secure and scalable fuel supply chains necessary for widespread fleet deployment. The Company believes the use of SALEU fuel is a strategic advantage given significant geopolitical challenges affecting the commercial availability of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel enriched to between 15% and 20% uranium-235.

In recent months, Terrestrial Energy has been selected for both the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy’s Advanced Reactor Pilot Program and its Fuel Line Pilot Program. Together, these programs provide a pathway to significantly accelerate Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR commercialization.

In February 2025, Terrestrial Energy further advanced its commercialization efforts when Texas A&M University selected Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR plant in a competitive RFP process to site a commercial IMSR plant at the Texas A&M-RELLIS campus. This partnership provides a high-profile platform to showcase a commercial IMSR plant, benefiting from the Texas A&M University System’s national leadership in nuclear technology research and development.

Excelerate Energy has signed a definitive commercial agreement for a fully integrated liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at the Port of Khor Al Zubair in Iraq.

The agreement was signed with a subsidiary of Iraq’s Ministry of Electricity at the Office of the Prime Minister.

The project involves a five-year contract that includes regasification services and LNG supply, with options for extension.

It guarantees a minimum of 250 million standard cubic feet per day (mscf/d) of offtake and accommodates a regasification capacity of 500mscf/d.

Excelerate will deploy its floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), Hull 3407, to the site, handling necessary equipment and berth modifications.

This project is expected to entail a total investment of around $450m, including the cost of the FSRU.

[TITLE]Nepal Calls for Renewable Energy Investment - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Nepal Invites International Investment in Renewable Energy

New Delhi – The Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Physical Infrastructure and Transport, and Urban Development, Kulman Ghising, has called upon the international community to invest in Nepal’s hydropower and solar power, as well as other renewable energy sources. Minister Ghising highlighted that Nepal’s journey towards clean energy is entering a crucial new era.

“With immense hydropower potential, growing solar energy capacity, and expanding cross-border transmission lines and energy connections, we have the potential to sustainably energize the region,” Ghising stated. “I invite our friendly nations and partners to invest in Nepal, invest in renewable energy, and become part of a brighter and greener future for all.”

Addressing a thematic session on “Envisioning Regional and Global Interconnections for Large-Scale Clean Energy Transition,” Ghising served as a key speaker on the sustainable development of vast energy potential and the roadmap for trilateral electricity trade (Nepal-India-Bangladesh). He emphasized that Nepal’s hydropower is a strategic enabler for clean energy transformation in South Asia.

He noted that Nepal’s hydropower is a crucial resource for a resilient and stable grid in the region. Ghising highlighted Nepal’s vision to become a major exporter of clean and green energy to South Asia, with hydropower production not only contributing to the country’s development but also supporting regional sustainability. He mentioned that Nepal and India are jointly identifying and constructing high-capacity transmission line infrastructure with the goal of exporting 15,000 MW of renewable energy by 2035.

Nepal is rich in energy resources, with approximately 83,000 MW of hydropower potential and around 42,000 MW of pumped storage hydropower potential. These resources are clean, renewable, and ideally complement the solar and wind energy of Nepal’s neighboring countries, he added.

He explained that as grids develop regionally and globally, interconnected transmission networks enable the flow of renewable energy between different regions, balancing electricity demand and supply, reducing costs, and expanding access.

“This vision aligns perfectly with the ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ concept, where clean energy flows seamlessly and sustainably across borders,” he said. “To turn this vision into reality, regional countries must move towards an integrated electricity market.”

“Ensuring a seamless, non-discriminatory, and unrestricted flow of green energy requires transparent regulations, standardization of norms, and open access to transmission infrastructure – key elements for attracting private investment and ensuring long-term sustainability.”

Ghising emphasized that cross-border energy cooperation is at the heart of Nepal’s clean energy vision. He stressed the need to strengthen transmission infrastructure between not only Nepal and India but also India and Bangladesh to establish a fully integrated grid among the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) countries, facilitating effective regional integration of electricity.

He called for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate the serious damage that climate change is inflicting on electricity systems and livelihoods.

Minister Ghising stated, “Another crucial aspect of sustainability is the resilience of our energy infrastructure to cope with the increasing impacts of climate change. Although Nepal’s contribution to carbon emissions is negligible, frequent floods and droughts are causing serious damage to our electricity systems and livelihoods, often requiring large-scale reconstruction. Therefore, strengthening climate-resilient infrastructure is our national priority, and we call for further strengthening regional and international cooperation to address and mitigate these climate-induced damages.” He reiterated the importance of investment in renewable energy for a sustainable future.

[TITLE]US electric utilities entering investment ‘super-cycle,’ says Morningstar DBRS:
[TEXT]
U.S. electric utilities are entering a five-year capital expenditure “super-cycle” as they build out transmission and generation networks to meet new demand from data centers, Morningstar DBRS said in a Monday research note.

“Investment in electricity infrastructure is projected to be $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030, double the amount invested in the prior 10 years,” the firm said. And based on data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Morningstar said many regions can expect load growth to increase from previously estimated 6.1% to around 11.6% over the next decade.

“The challenges posed by the rapid buildout of data centers are overlaid on existing concerns for most utilities, including decarbonization and guaranteeing the reliability of grid infrastructure while increasing the contribution of renewable power,” Morningstar said. “The projected surge in demand provides opportunities for utilities that must be counterbalanced with structural changes and regulatory support for utilities and rate payers.”

"We anticipate that regulated utilities with supportive regulatory commissions, solid credit ratings, and access to capital markets will deploy the needed capex to take advantage of the data center boom," Bukola Folashakin, Morningstar assistant vice president of corporate ratings, said in a statement. "We expect this capex investment in turn to make such utility locations attractive for more data center construction, potentially creating a cycle of increased revenue for as long as data centers remain economically viable."

Some states — Morningstar named California, Texas, and Louisiana — will see elevated risks of resource inadequacy next year that “in extreme conditions, could trigger electricity shortfalls,” according to the note.

Morningstar’s analysis mirror’s recent capital expenditure estimates from the Edison Electric Institute, which expects U.S electricity generation to grow “for the foreseeable future.” The group, which represents investor-owned utilities, said generation rose 3% in 2024 and generation investments as a share of the industry’s total capital expenditures have risen for four straight years.

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.

Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report. And those data centers bring demand surges that are driving “higher tolls for other customer segments,” which “will be exacerbated as more data centers become operational.”

Meeting the demand requires massive utility investment but “traditional funding sources are inadequate to meet future investment needs,” Morningstar said. “Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.
