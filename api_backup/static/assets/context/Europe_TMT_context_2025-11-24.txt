A strong year for initial public offerings on Wall Street has fizzled out due to the government shutdown and a cautious turn by investors.

Many IPOs targeted for the end of this year will likely be pushed into next year as the Securities and Exchange Commission works to clear a backlog of hundreds of registration statements. Meanwhile, shares of companies that did make their market debuts haven’t fared well lately amid concerns that stocks have gotten too expensive after another double-digit gain for the market this year.

“A backlogged SEC, the approaching holiday slowdown, and pressure on AI and other tech stocks are all weighing on hopes for a near-term rebound,” wrote Bill Smith, CEO of Renaissance Capital, in a note to investors.

Despite the backlog, Wall Street is still anticipating several IPOs in November and December that were already in the later stages of the regulatory process.

[TITLE]Humanoid robot arrives at Kenyan university as Africa joins global AI training race:
[TEXT]
Walker E humanoid robot on display at Mount Kenya University Thika campus, part of new AI and robotics lab giving students hands-on training in programming and automation.

A humanoid robot now walks the corridors of a Kenyan university, marking what educators say is the first deployment of such technology for student training in the region.

The Walker E Educational Humanoid Robot, manufactured by Chinese firm UBTech Robotics, can recognise speech and images, walk on two legs and perform tasks typically done by humans. Students will program and train the machine as part of coursework in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science.

The acquisition comes as humanoid robots move from research laboratories to factory floors worldwide. UBTech began mass production of its industrial Walker S2 model this month, with orders exceeding 800 million yuan (Sh14.5 billion) since January. Major automakers including BYD, Geely and Audi have deployed the robots on production lines.

Mount Kenya University this week unveiled the robot alongside a new robotics and AI laboratory at its Thika campus, positioning the institution to offer hands-on training in fields driving global technology investment.

"Using this robot, students will learn how to program a robot, how to train it to perform new tasks and also develop and test new algorithms," said John Kamau, Dean of the School of Computing and Informatics.

UBTech began mass production of its industrial Walker S2 model this month, with orders exceeding 800 million yuan (Sh14.5 billion) since January. Major automakers including BYD, Geely and Audi have deployed the robots on production lines.

For students in Kenya, the technology offers exposure to systems that industry analysts predict will number in the tens of millions globally within a decade.

"AI is the next big thing and let us make use of it," observed Simon Gicharu, chairman of the university's board of trustees.

The 172-centimetre robot features 21 degrees of freedom in its joints, can sprint at 10 kilometres per hour and operates for up to eight hours on hot-swappable batteries. Its computing system delivers 550 trillion operations per second, enabling navigation across complex terrain.

Gicharu said the university plans to establish an innovation grant to fund student projects that could advance from concept to prototype through its incubation hub. He challenged students to compete in hackathons to sharpen their problem-solving abilities.

The laboratory will support research into human-robot interaction and enable students to develop and test their own robotic products.

Beyond robotics, the university upgraded its dental training with a Phantom Head Skills Laboratory, where students practice procedures on simulated patients before treating real ones. The dental equipment uses AI-driven scanners to create custom dental prosthetics.

"When you look at the dental lab, the machines that we have put on the table are all AI driven, where you are able to take the scan of somebody's mouth and commission the making of a tooth for that particular patient," explained Jaganyi.

The School of Engineering also received new equipment for experiments in solar and wind energy technologies.

Jaganyi said the investments reflect a commitment to preparing students for a labour market increasingly shaped by automation.

"Students now have access to world-class facilities that foster creativity, practical skills and the ability to solve real-world challenges," he noted.

[TITLE]SpaceX Might Lose Almost No Time for Booster Shell, COPVs and Test Tank Loss:
[TEXT]
The loss of Booster 18 during gas pressure testing only cost SpaceX the shell of a booster. There were no raptor engines in it.

UPDATE SpaceX says they will stack the Booster 19 Super Heavy Booster in December, 2025. They plan to keep the flight test for First Quarter 2026.

The Starbase team plans to have the next Super Heavy booster stacked in December, which puts it on pace with the test schedule planned for the first Starship V3 vehicle and associated ground systems. Starship’s twelfth flight test remains targeted for the first quarter of 2026. — SpaceX (@SpaceX) November 22, 2025

This was the loss of only the shell, COPVs and test tank. It was a routine gas-system pressure test. It was before structural proof testing. The LOX tank ruptured around 4:04 a.m. CT on November 21, crumpling and blowing out the lower section (aft/LOX tank area) while leaving the upper structure partially intact.

Currently, the Booster is being held up by the new, larger Liquid Methane (LCH4) transfer tube, and it is unknown how SpaceX will safe this vehicle so that crews can return to Masseys. SpaceX either needs to find a way to collapse the booster safely and then clean up the scraps, or use the LR11000 crane at Masseys to stabilize it and scrap it.

The two-three month delay adjustments to avoid delay means that 2026 Starship work can still focus on NASA HLS tests and refueling work needed and keep schedules. The start and ramp of Starlink version 3 launches will not slip if launch is still good in Q1 2026.

Booster 19 hasn’t even started its stacking process in Mega Bay 1, and even if it were to start today, barring any investigation and modification time, the booster testing schedule might still be maintained.

Another consequence of this failure is that SpaceX no longer has a booster to commission Pad 2. This is a big deal, as all the tank farm equipment must be tested during vehicle loading to verify that it works correctly. SpaceX could try to modify B18.1 to fit inside the launch mount for testing, or teams could try to salvage the aft section of Booster 18 and stick some small tanks on it. SpaceX plans to have a booster in a 2-3 weeks.

If root cause ties to a V3-specific change then a minor redesign could add 1-3 months. So best case of no delay and worst case

Microsoft Introduces Convenient New 47-Factor Authentication

BabylonBee.com ^ | Nov 21, 2025 | The Babylon Bee

Posted on by E. Pluribus Unum

https://babylonbee.com/news/microsoft-introduces-convenient-new-47-factor-authentication

SEATTLE, WA — The Microsoft Corporation announced today that they've developed a convenient new 47-factor authentication protocol for all Windows-enabled computers.

A spokesperson for Microsoft said that the new unnecessarily complicated measure serves as the company's latest response to the ever-increasing need for digital security.

"Two factors just weren't secure enough," said Wayne Parkington, director of media relations at Microsoft. "So we went back to the drawing board to design a simple, easy-to-use, 47-factor security protocol that anyone can remember."

Starting today, users will need to enter their usernames and passwords to log in, followed by an authentication code sent to their phones. "After that," Parkinson said, "they'll just need to type in their email addresses, last 4 digits of their phone numbers, their mothers' maiden names, street addresses, shoe sizes, inseam lengths, amounts they say they weigh, their actual weights, hair colors, eye colors, nose hair colors, license plate numbers, names of firstborn children, middle names of firstborn children, Social Security numbers, favorite sports teams, left eye prescriptions, preferred toothpaste brands, toaster settings, credit card numbers, PLU codes of randomly-selected fruit or vegetables, high school GPAs, names of first employers, recommended tire pressures for their respective vehicles, pets' ages, family medical histories, TSA known-traveler numbers, European shoe sizes, heights (in centimeters), favorite Bible verses, colors of their first cars, favorite movie quotes, credit scores, blood types, skin colors, latest cholesterol readings, least-favorite pizza toppings, first pets' names, refrigerator temperature settings, 3rd favorite TV shows, streets they grew up on, dates they last trimmed their toenails, Little League batting averages, and first grade teachers' middle names. And that's all."

Consumers were already responding positively to the upgrade. "Honestly, this is simpler than having to identify all of the images with crosswalks or..."

US government pullback from climate science fuels boom for private data firms

Reuters ^ | November 22, 2025 | By Katy Daigle and Simon Jessop

Posted on by Oldeconomybuyer

… U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been slashing spending for science services at a time of surging demand for analytics due to escalating climate change and extreme weather. That is helping to drive a data industry boom for private data companies like Climate X that are providing everything from drought or pollution risk assessments to locations for untapped mineral reserves.

Revenues for the earth intelligence sector should rise at least 10% to $4.2 billion by 2030, market analysis firm Gartner said, teasing the industry in July as a "new revenue growth opportunity."

The industry's impact could be even more significant. The World Economic Forum has estimated earth intelligence will help reduce risk, grow opportunities, and generate jobs for a total $3.8 trillion in economic value by 2030, up from $266 billion today.

The private data boom is also raising questions around accuracy and access for those unable to pay. Private companies can do only so much without baseline data from U.S. government agencies such as NOAA, according to officials from more than a dozen firms who spoke with Reuters.

"Without it we wouldn't know if our models are good or bad, frankly," Climate X co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Kamil Kluza said.

With U.S. datasets for climate-related information like methane plumes or flood maps possibly vanishing from the public sphere, Kluza's company plans to lean on alternatives from the EU, Japan and UK Met Office.

“surging demand for analytics due to escalating climate change and extreme weather” What garbage For anything as complex as weather, any single year or a couple consecutive years of events is just random. Grouping in ten-year segments seemed to provide information. In the hard sciences of Math and Physics, the earth’s climate is known as an open system, meaning all influencers are probabilistic and not deterministic. Any assertions must be less than certain, and any models developed from such assertions must suffer a continuing decrease in probability the further they are extended into the future. I found an insight from an article with a map showing 173 individual hurricanes hitting land on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts from 1850 to present. I decided to see if the upward sloping curve caused by warming ocean temperatures I have always heard about from the climate change people would show more extreme weather. Like everything else they say, it did not make sense. 173 Years of US Hurricane Strikes https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4285273/posts 1851-60: 17 1861-70: 17 1871-80: 20 1881-90: 20 1891-00: 28 1901-10: 23 1911-20: 21 1921-30: 17 1931-40: 24 1941-50: 31 1951-60: 35 1961-70: 17 1971-80: 15 1981-90: 18 1991-00: 15 2001-10: 23 2011-20: 19 2021-24: 12 Concerning a single event, I had the 20:00 to 24:00 OOD watch on the bridge on our ship as Typhoon Rose passed over Hong Kong in 1971. The eye was six miles from us. The measuring device at the British weather station broke as the winds exceeded 175 miles per hour.

[TITLE]Global tech stocks climb as Nvidia results spark relief rally soothing AI bubble concerns:
[TEXT]
Dan Hanbury, global equity portfolio manager at Ninety One, which holds Nvidia as its second-largest holding in its global strategic equity fund, cautiously welcomed Nvidia's share price jump in Thursday's premarket trade. "As a holder, it's great to see an early positive reaction but of course as we know those reactions can reverse further into the day," Hanbury told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." "Our reading of the numbers is they are very strong. Clearly, we can get caught up in the quarterly noise of a company like this but if we just put those [numbers] in context … only three years ago they were delivering $15 billion of data center revenue, we're now looking at consensus forecasts into next year of $280 billion," Hanbury said. "That is phenomenal growth that these guys are delivering."

[TITLE]Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance:
[TEXT]
The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code.

Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion.

Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just

[TITLE]FCC rolls back cybersecurity rules for telcos, despite state-hacking risks:
[TEXT]
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has rolled back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures following the massive hack from the Chinese threat group known as Salt Typhoon.

The ruling came in January 2025 and took effect immediately under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), in response to Salt Typhoon's breaching multiple carriers to spy on private communications.

Along with Section 105 of the CALEA, the declaratory ruling included a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for telecom companies to:

Create and implement cybersecurity risk-management plans

Submit annual FCC certifications proving they were doing so

Treat general network cybersecurity as a legal obligation

Following lobbying from telecommunication firms - according to a letter from Senator Maria Cantwell, that found the new framework too cumbersome and taxing for their operations, the FCC has now deemed the prior rule inflexible, retracting it.

“The Federal Communications Commission today took action to correct course and rescind an unlawful and ineffective prior Declaratory Ruling misconstruing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA),” reads the FCC announcement.

“The Order also withdraws an NPRM that accompanied that Declaratory Ruling, which was based in part on the Declaratory Ruling’s flawed legal analysis and proposed ineffective cybersecurity requirements.”

The FCC, which is now under new leadership, noted that communications service providers have taken important steps to strengthen their cybersecurity posture following the Salt Typhoon incidents, and have agreed to continue along this path in a coordinated manner, reducing risks to national security.

Disclosed in October 2024, the Salt Typhoon attacks were linked to a Chinese espionage campaign that impacted several companies, including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies [1], T-Mobile [2], Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications [3], and Windstream [4].

The hackers accessed core systems that U.S. federal government used for court-authorized network wiretapping requests, and potentially intercepted extremely sensitive information, up to the level of government officials.

FCC's plan met with criticism

Given that the risk for similar hacker operations remains unchanged, the FCC’s latest decision was met with criticism.

Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the only one voting against the current decision, expressed frustration about the reliance on telecom providers for self-evaluating their cybersecurity stance and the effectiveness of the protective measures.

“Its [FCCs] proposed rollback is not a cybersecurity strategy,” stated Gomez. “It is a hope and a dream that will leave Americans less protected than they were the day the Salt Typhoon breach was discovered.”

“Salt Typhoon was not a one-off event but part of a broader campaign by state-sponsored actors to infiltrate telecommunications networks over long periods of time,” Gomez warned in her statement.

“Federal officials have stated publicly that similar reconnaissance and exploitation attempts are ongoing today, and that telecommunications networks remain high-value targets for foreign adversaries,” the official said.

Senators Maria Cantwell and Gary Peters have also sent letters to the FCC before the vote to urge the agency to maintain the cybersecurity safeguards.

BleepingComputer has emailed the FCC for a statement and will update the article when we get a reply.

[TITLE]UK backs next-generation satellite communications with £6.9 million investment:
[TEXT]
The funding will support five groundbreaking projects through the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ARTES (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) programme, part of the Directorate of Connectivity and Secure Communications. These projects showcase British expertise in next-generation satellite technologies and strengthen the UK’s role in advanced communications.

This investment underpins the UK’s Industrial Strategy priority capabilities: Satellite Communications, Position, Navigation and Timing, In-orbit Servicing and Manufacturing, Space Domain Awareness, and Space Data for Earth Applications.

With European demand for satellites up to 2033 forecasted to be worth £40 billion, even 2% of this would bring around £800 million in revenues for the UK economy alone.

Space Minister Liz Lloyd said:

Space technology and especially satellites, are essential to our daily lives. From the sat nav in your car to your mobile phone, from weather forecasts to your online banking – space is where it all happens. By backing our UK sector, we’re not only cementing our position as a European space leader – we’re creating high-skilled jobs, attracting investment, and ensuring space technologies can connect communities to the space-enabled services they need.

The five UK-led projects span critical areas of innovation in satellite communications, from refuelling satellites to extend their lifespans, to developing 5G networks and optical links that will improve global connectivity.

Orbit Fab will deliver the Advancing Satcom Technology with Refuelling and Logistics (ASTRAL) project with a total UK funding of up to £2.9 million. The contract for the first stage of the mission, worth £1.3 million, has now been awarded by ESA. This mission will prove the capability to refuel electric propulsion satellites using UK-developed technology, ensuring satellites can remain in orbit for longer or can manoeuvre away from threats.

Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall will lead the AGILE: Antenna Ground Interface and LunaNet Equipment project, supported by £1.6 million in funding. Amidst the growing number of lunar missions, this project will produce an interface unit that can be installed in global antennas to communicate with spacecraft using the internationally recognised LunaNet specification. This will allow missions to seamlessly connect to ground infrastructure, improving mission success rates.

Vicinity Technologies will receive £1.19 million for its 5G NTN-based Satellite Access Networks project. The team will design and develop a versatile 5G Non-Terrestrial Network regenerative payload system and user terminals, including the entire software stack for both space and ground segments. This technology will support uninterrupted and scalable internet services globally, from hard-to-reach areas to smart cities.

Archangel Lightworks, working with the support of Eutelsat will advance optical communications through the Space Optical Link Integration Study (SOLIS) project, funded with £356,000. This study, delivered under ESA’s Sunrise programme, will investigate use cases for deploying Free Space Optical Communications technology within Eutelsat’s OneWeb LEO global network.

Finally, Inmarsat Navigation Ventures Ltd (Viasat UK) will receive £881,000 for the International Virtual Satellite Operators Network (Phase 2) project. This initiative will develop a service that enables governments to plan, procure, manage and monitor satellite communications services from Viasat and other providers, ensuring secure and coherent management of critical communications.

Dr Paul Bate, CEO of the UK Space Agency, said:

Today’s investment shows how the UK’s space ambitions translate into real-world impact. By advancing satellite communications technology, we’re not only building a globally competitive sector but also ensuring that communities – even in the most remote corners of the UK – can access the services they need. This is space delivering for people and powering our future economy.

By helping businesses, universities and research institutions commercialise breakthrough technologies, the government is creating high-skilled jobs in the UK’s £18.9 billion space sector and delivering tangible benefits - from improved weather forecasting to enhanced national security.

Laurent Jaffart, Director of ESA’s Connectivity and Secure Communications, said:

ESA is committed to supporting a vibrant and striving telecommunications ecosystem in Europe, while achieving a zero-debris environment in space. This milestone, with support from the UK Space Agency, will further strengthen the European autonomy and sovereignty that we are collectively striving for with our Member States.

Dr Colin Baldwin, Executive Director of the UKspace Trade Association, said:

UKspace’s Satellite Telecommunications Committee, run jointly with techUK, has made a strong case that our industry has the expertise, technology and talent to capture a significant portion of the global satellite communications market over the coming decade. We are delighted to see so many of our member companies benefiting from and taking advantage of the UK Space Agency’s investment in the ARTES programme at the ESA Council of Ministers meeting in 2022 continuing to develop new innovations which will help to achieve this goal.

This funding comes ahead of the ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen on 26-27 November, where the Government will negotiate the UK’s investment into the future of Europe’s space ambitions, with a focus on economic growth and national security. Evaluation shows that every £1 invested in ESA returns £7.49 in direct benefits to the UK economy.

As well as ESA programmes, the UK space sector has access to a wider range of national space funding than ever before. To support national programmes and the UK’s membership of ESA, the government allocated the UK Space Agency a budget of £2.8 billion up to 2029/30.

From pioneering satellite refuelling to transforming connectivity in remote areas, these projects show how investment in space delivers real benefits for people’s everyday lives.

U.S. wireless giant Verizon has announced more than 13,000 job cuts in what will be the company’s biggest single round of layoffs, as part of a broad effort to streamline operations and reduce costs. The decision follows mounting market pressures and slowing growth in new wireless subscribers amid increased competition in the sector.In addition to the layoffs, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail outlets into franchised stores and shut down one location. The company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to take a severance charge of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter. More than 80% of affected staff are expected to exit next month. Verizon shares fell 1% on Thursday following the announcement.CEO Dan Schulman told employees in a company memo that the workforce reduction would be accompanied by cuts to outsourced services and external labor expenses. “Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,” Schulman wrote in a note to employees seen by Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.”A spokesperson confirmed the move, calling it “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”Reuters and other outlets had reported earlier that the company was planning job cuts totaling around 15,000, primarily within the U.S. workforce.Schulman also announced the creation of a $20 million career transition fund to support displaced employees, stating it would help workers build “the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company stressed that the layoffs were not tied to its use of artificial intelligence.Verizon is contending with fierce competition from legacy rivals and cable providers that have entered the wireless market with lower-priced offerings. Schulman, who joined the company as CEO in October from PayPal and has served on Verizon’s board since 2018, faces an industry environment in which AT&T and T-Mobile have ramped up promotions around new iPhone launches, offering aggressive discounts and trade-in deals.The carrier added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, trailing AT&T, while T-Mobile led the industry with more than 1 million net additions.Verizon had roughly 100,000 employees in the United States at the end of 2024, including

[TITLE]IPO market’s red-hot year has been cooled by the shutdown and more caution among investors:
[TEXT]
A strong year for initial public offerings on Wall Street has fizzled out due to the government shutdown and a cautious turn by investors.

Many IPOs targeted for the end of this year will likely be pushed into next year as the Securities and Exchange Commission works to clear a backlog of hundreds of registration statements. Meanwhile, shares of companies that did make their market debuts haven’t fared well lately amid concerns that stocks have gotten too expensive after another double-digit gain for the market this year.

“A backlogged SEC, the approaching holiday slowdown, and pressure on AI and other tech stocks are all weighing on hopes for a near-term rebound,” wrote Bill Smith, CEO of Renaissance Capital, in a note to investors.

Despite the backlog, Wall Street is still anticipating several IPOs in November and December that were already in the later stages of the regulatory process.

Central Bancompany was one of the bigger companies going public following the end of the government shutdown. The bank holding company for The Central Trust Bank raised $373 million from its IPO on Thursday. Still, November is on track to be among the slowest months for IPOs in 2025, according to Renaissance Capital.

Wall Street anticipates that medical supplies company Medline could go public in December, potentially raising up to $5 billion, while cryptocurrency technology company BitGo remains another potential IPO for next month.

The more cautious turn for the market has also checked the gains of some more recent IPOs, sending some falling sharply since their debuts.

Web design software company Figma has essentially lost all its gains since going public in July. It more than tripled on its first day of trading after pricing at $33 per share. It is now trading slightly above the IPO price.

Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company priced its IPO at $40 per share in September and is currently trading close to $29 per share. Cloud computing company CoreWeave also priced its IPO at $40 per share, in March. It surged in the months following its IPO, but has pulled back significantly to

[TITLE]Crypto Market Crash 'A Generational Opportunity For Long Term Investors,' Bitwise Investment Chief Says:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

The cryptocurrency market’s recent crash represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, according to Bitwise investment chief Matt Hougan.

“I think it’s a generational opportunity for long-term investors, whether you’re looking at Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana,” Hougan told CNBC on Tuesday.

Over the past month, the cryptocurrency market has wiped out $1 trillion in value, as Bitcoin has tanked as much as 29% from its price record of $126,000 reached last month to briefly trade below $90,000 for the first time since April.

Don't Miss:

Hougan attributed the market volatility to broader concerns about the economy, artificial intelligence valuations and tariffs. He said he is bullish on cryptocurrencies despite these concerns because they are supported by “secular trends that are decoupled” from those issues, citing the growth of stablecoins, tokenization, prediction markets and digital identity.

“To get in at these prices, I think, really is almost a gift for long-term investors,” he said. “It’s a tremendous opportunity.”

Meanwhile, according to Hougan, the cryptocurrency market correction is “nearing a bottom.”

“Bitcoin was the first thing to turn over before this broader market pullback,” he said. “It was sort of the canary in the coal mine, signaling that there was some risk in all sorts of risk on assets. I think it’ll be the first thing to bottom.”

During the same segment, Bitmine (NASDAQ:BMNR) Chair Tom Lee said Bitcoin could still rally to new highs this year, buoyed by an anticipated rally in the stock market.

Hougan and Lee are not the only analysts to sound optimistic on cryptocurrency prices amid the recent slump. Standard Chartered Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick, in a Tuesday note, said the market correction was over. He cited the collapse of the multiple to net asset value of Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) to 1.

“I think this is enough to signify the sell-off is over and to eventually disprove those who think the halving cycle remains valid,” Kendrick said. “A rally into year-end is my base case.”

Bitcoin has pared some of its losses to most recently trade near $92,000.
