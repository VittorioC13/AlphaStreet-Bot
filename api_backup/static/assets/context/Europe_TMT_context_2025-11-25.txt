[TEXT]
Even as DIY investing apps dominate headlines, a chunk of mutual fund money in India is still routed through human advisers. While popular investing apps such as Zerodha and Groww race to cut out middlemen, there is Wealthy that is making a contrarian, high‑stakes bet on keeping human advisers at the centre of India’s wealth‑technology (wealth‑tech) stack.

The Bengaluru-based startup has raised ₹130 crore in fresh funding, led by Bertelsmann India Investments, to deepen its artificial intelligence (AI)-led platform for mutual fund distributors (MFDs), with participation from existing investor Alphawave Global, new investor Shepherd’s Hill and a clutch of tech entrepreneurs.

Instead of going direct to consumers, Wealthy looks to sell software and AI tools to MFDs—independent mutual fund distributors who still intermediate roughly 80% of India’s retail equity wealth—so they can handle know-your-customer (KYC) checks, compliance and portfolio reviews faster, and sell investment products more efficiently while staying the primary advisers to their clients.

ASX tech stock Catapult Group International (ASX: CAT) has rarely delivered a dull moment for investors. The share price of the sports-technology group has been as unpredictable as the sports it helps measure.

Catapult's share price was up more than 110% at one point this year, then sliding 35% over the past month before bouncing back at the end of last week, finishing with a 4.4% gain at $4.51.

Expansion in elite leagues

The sharp moves reflect both the promise and growing pains of a company still trying to turn global adoption into consistent commercial momentum. This Melbourne-based ASX tech stock is best known for its wearable GPS performance trackers and analytics platforms used by elite teams worldwide.

Behind the volatile share is a business that is quietly gaining traction. It has been steadily expanding its footprint across the US, Europe, and major professional leagues, including the NBA, Premier League, and top rugby competitions. Catapult has reached a level of global market penetration that few Australian firms in the tech sector have achieved.

In its latest half-year results update Catapult reported annualised contract value of US$115.8 million, a 19% lift compared to the year before. The average contract value per team also continues to rise, and the company reports that customers now typically stay with Catapult for nearly 8 years.

Soccer scouting and analysis

Catapult is also expanding strategically. The sports tech company snapped up Perch, a specialist business in strength-training technology, and last month took over Impect GmbH, a German analytics provider focused on elite soccer scouting and analysis.

The acquisitions align well with Catapult's long-term vision of becoming the global platform of choice for professional sports teams. They strengthen the product portfolio of the ASX tech stock and deepen its data capabilities. These are key advantages as top sports teams continue to invest more in performance tracking and match intelligence.

Prior expansion mishaps

The market wasn't too impressed, especially not with the acquisition of the German company Impect. Investors clearly balked at the dilution from the capital raise and the hefty price tag, especially with prior expansion mishaps still fresh in their minds.

Analysts are cautiously optimistic. Most see the ASX tech stock as a genuine global contender, underpinned by sticky recurring revenue, high-profile clients and growing demand for data-driven performance tools.

However, they warn that execution risks remain. Catapult must translate scale into profitability more consistently and continue to sharpen its cost base. Brokers also closely watch the integration of acquisitions like Impect.

What is the upside?

The dominant broker view is 'buy', with an average target price of $7.97. Bell Potter recently retained its buy rating on the ASX 200 tech stock, but reduced the price target to $6.50, from $7.50. Based on its current share price, this implies potential upside of approximately 44% for investors between now and this time next year.

Commenting on its buy recommendation, Bell Potter said:

[TITLE]AI momentum is real: But what’s in it for investors?:
[TEXT]
The AI train

AI vs dot-com bubble

A slice of AI in your MF

Not all circular deals mislead

Risks are real

Global chip giant Nvidia reported that its revenues had soared 62% to $57 billion in the quarter ending October 2025, and projected sales would climb to $65 billion in the current quarter. Just as investors and sceptics were beginning to doubt the artificial intelligence (AI) run, Nvidia’s robust results appear to have reassured some that the AI momentum is real. The question is, how long can this good run continue?Corporations are also investing heavily in AI. Reports state that Google plans to invest $40 billion, while Oracle has committed $3 billion over the next five years. Bosch, the German multinational engineering and technology company, aims to deploy Euro 2.5 billion by 2027, while Nvidia has outlined plans to invest $10 billion in AI. Indian companies are also placing their bets. L&T recently invested Rs.1,407 crore for a 21% stake in E2E Networks, a firm specialising in AI and data centre development. Tata Elxsi, Zensar Technologies, Affle 3i and Persistent Systems have all announced AI-led strategies.Countries like the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and China have been pouring billions into AI data centres, chips and cloud infrastructure. India is also pursuing AI bets, albeit slowly. The industry believes that AI is the next big thing and no one wants to be late for the party.The excitement is contagious. Asset managers, retail investors and global giants are all convinced that AI will reshape the world. Select Indian mutual fund (MF) schemes have taken a sizeable exposure to the AI theme. Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund has nearly Rs.19,000 crore—around 16% of its portfolio—allocated to AI-linked companies, as per Morningstar. With US indices now having over 30% weight in AI stocks, global exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are mirroring this trend. The Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 ETF allocates more than one-third of its assets to AI stocks, while the Mirae NYSE FANG+ ETF allocates more than half, as of October 2025, according to Morningstar data. Even Warren Buffett’s cautious portfolio has roughly 27% exposure to businesses deeply integrated with AI-led ecosystems, as per a report by Nasdaq.com.Even if AI reshapes the world, is every company riding the wave worthy of the premium it commands today? Oracle is a clear example. Its share price climbed from around $150 to nearly $350 within a year purely on the strength of the AI narrative, before slipping back to the $220 range. AI doesn’t seem like a fad. Or is this irrational exuberance?Some experts are comparing this period to the 2000 dot-com era. There was tremendous optimism, massive capital flows, soaring valuations and little regard for whether demand would catch up. Several MF schemes were launched to capitalise on the Internet theme, some of whose net asset values (NAVs) fell to as low as Rs.2-3 when the theme unravelled. The Internet eventually changed the world, but hundreds of companies collapsed before that happened. In the late 1990s, companies with no customers, no sales, and certainly no profits were fetching rich valuations based purely on website traffic, which they hoped would convert into revenue. When the revenue didn’t come, the entire pack collapsed.Some reckon that today’s AI boom has similar ingredients. Countless startups are being launched, billions are being deployed, and expectations are sky-high. “Billions are being poured into graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI data centres. Everyone’s chasing the future. AI will be the future, but companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and OpenAI might be over-allocating capital to AI,” says Kirtan Shah, Founder and CEO of Truvanta Wealth.Funds with largest volume of AI stocks in their portfolios.Vikas Gupta, CIO, Omniscience Capital, offers a different view: “In the dot-com era, companies didn’t even have revenues. Today’s AI giants make $300-500 billion in revenue and nearly $100 billion in annual cash flows. These are extremely profitable companies.” This alone makes the current cycle very different.Viram Shah, Founder & CEO, Vested Finance, agrees. “These companies are fundamentally strong, with solid earnings and leadership in critical technologies like cloud AI, chips, and generative software,” he says.Even valuations today are nowhere near the extremes of 2000. At the peak of the dot-com bubble, the top technology names traded at around 70 times the two-year forward earnings. In comparison, today’s biggest AI spenders—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta—trade closer to 26-30 times the forward earnings. Higher than normal, but far from bubble territory. Another similarity often highlighted is concentration. Today, the socalled ‘Magnificent Seven’ account for

China’s CHOKEHOLD Threatens America’s Military Might

Conservative Journal ^ | Sat, Nov 22 at 10:51 PM | Staff

Posted on by UMCRevMom@aol.com

China’s strategic stranglehold on rare earth minerals threatens America’s national security and economic independence, leaving our defense and technology sectors dangerously vulnerable to Beijing’s whims.

OVERVIEW

• China controls 85-95% of global rare earth processing through decades of state-directed monopolization

• Beijing weaponized export restrictions in April 2025, targeting seven critical rare earth elements in response to U.S. tariffs

• America’s defense, electronics, and renewable energy sectors face severe supply chain vulnerabilities

• Western efforts to break China’s chokehold require years of investment and face massive technical barriers

CHINA'S CALCULATED ECONOMIC WARFARE STRATEGY

China’s dominance over rare earth elements represents a masterclass in economic warfare that began in the 1980s. Beijing systematically undercut global competitors by flooding markets with cheap rare earths, forcing American and Western mines to close due to unsustainable pricing.

The Communist Party declared these materials strategically important in the 1990s, blocking foreign investment while pouring state resources into domestic capacity. This wasn’t market competition—it was deliberate economic conquest designed to create dependency.

The scope of China’s control extends far beyond simple mining operations. Beijing controls the entire supply chain from extraction to the complex chemical processing required to produce high-purity materials essential for advanced technologies.

State-owned enterprises like China Rare-Earths Group, which controls 70% of domestic production, operate under direct Communist Party oversight. This vertical integration gives China unprecedented leverage over global industries that depend on these critical materials for everything from military hardware to smartphones.

AMERICA'S DANGEROUS DEPENDENCY EXPOSED

The 2010 diplomatic crisis with Japan revealed the true extent of China’s stranglehold when Beijing restricted rare earth exports over a territorial dispute. This incident sent shockwaves through Western capitals as they realized their critical industries could be held hostage by Chinese political decisions.

The situation has only worsened since then, with China consolidating control through export quotas, production limits, and environmental regulations that conveniently don’t apply to state-favored enterprises.

China’s April 2025 export restrictions on seven rare earth elements demonstrate how Beijing weaponizes these materials against American interests. These new controls directly target U.S. defense contractors and technology companies, potentially disrupting production of everything from F-35 fighter jets to wind turbines.

The timing coincides with broader trade tensions, proving China views rare earths as a geopolitical weapon rather than mere commodities. This represents a clear threat to American sovereignty and industrial capacity.

BREAKING FREE FROM BEIJING'S GRIP

President Trump’s administration and allied Western governments have recognized the urgent need to break China’s rare earth monopoly. The U.S., European Union, and Australia have launched ambitious programs to develop domestic processing capabilities and secure alternative supply chains.

However, these efforts face enormous technical and financial obstacles that China has spent decades perfecting through state subsidies and environmental corner-cutting that Western nations rightfully refuse to replicate.

The path to rare earth independence requires sustained American resolve and significant investment in domestic capabilities. Companies like MP Materials are working to establish U.S. processing facilities, but achieving meaningful production scale will take years of dedicated effort.

China’s willingness to absorb massive environmental costs and subsidize unprofitable operations through state resources gives them advantages that free-market economies must overcome through innovation, efficiency, and strategic government support that protects national security without compromising conservative principles of limited government.

Despite the consolidation phase, Nifty is trading below its intrinsic value, says Nimesh Chandan , CIO of Bajaj Finserv Asset Management. He believes this undervaluation presents a strong entry point for investors, with earnings growth expected to accelerate in FY26–27. Chandan is bullish on BFSI consumption , pharma, chemicals, and home improvement as key sectors for generating alpha.The current equity market setup reflects a phase of consolidation, yet underlying fundamentals are improving. We are seeing an acceleration in economic growth; corporate earnings growth is improving; steps taken on the fiscal side and the monetary side are showing their impact on the demand or consumption side. We are likely to see higher capacity utilisation in the corporate sector, and that will encourage private capex. We hope that India will be able to sign a favourable trade agreement with the US and the EU and trigger a revival in exports too.While global uncertainties persist, with the combination of strong earnings momentum, resilient domestic demand, and bottom-up opportunities across large, mid, and small caps, we believe the markets are poised for an upcycle from here on.Over the past 12–14 months, the Indian equity market witnessed net selling by FIIs. There were multiple factors at play – a slowdown in corporate earnings, geopolitical issues, higher valuation comfort in some other emerging nations, and uncertainty around US trade tariffs. While the lack of AI-focused plays is one among these multiple reasons, we do not see it as a key deterrent of FII flows. India has always offered strong diversification to global portfolios due to its unique demographics, faster economic growth, and a diversified basket of high-quality businesses.After a substantial relative underperformance over the past 12–15 months versus the emerging market index, Indian markets now offer an improved growth-valuation dynamic for global investors. India presents a unique investment case today – strong growth prospects, robust balance sheets, and a stable government. As the emerging market bull cycle enters its next phase, a high-quality market like India should see a rebound in capital flows. A likely earnings upcycle in H2FY26 and FY27 could provide a further fillip.It is a fact that India is not seen as one of the pioneering nations in AI-related developments. However, it is too early to draw conclusions

What are EV makers importing?

India's emerging electric car market remains under the shadow of Chinese imports as the manufacturers continue to rely on the world's largest exporter for key components such as semiconductors, batteries and magnets. A report in the Times of India reveals that only six of every 46 (around 13%) electric vehicle (EV) models sold in India have been found eligible for benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme of the government, as they meet the domestic value-addition mandates.The rest 87% EV models in India were marked ineligible for PLI as they carried imported content more than the stipulated levels with the vast part of components coming in from China, sources told TOI.As per the Ministry of Heavy Industries' PLI Scheme for automobile companies and auto components released in September 2021, automakers are required to meet a minimum 50% domestic value addition (DVA) and follow Phased Manufacturing Programme similar to FAME-II Scheme. The government provides a relaxation on import of battery cells that takes the DVA cut-off lower to 40%As per TOI's sources, the government has approved six models under the scheme, including five car models from Tata Motors and one from Mahindra . "All the other models sold in the market, including from companies such as JSW MG, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Citroen, VinFast, Volvo, Tesla and Audi, have over 60% imported content," the source said.The EV models that have gained from the PLI scheme are - Tata Punch , Tata Nexon, and Tata Harrier SUVs, Tata Tiago hatch, and Tata Tigor sedan, along with Mahindra XEV9E.Tata's popular EV Curvv and Mahindra BE6 green did not meet PLI's local value addition criteria, despite other models from the autogiants making the cut.Officials from companies whose models did not make the cut told TOI that meeting the DVA criteria at such a nascent stage of EV adoption remains challenging. "The local supply ecosystem for EVs is still not as evolved as it is in the internal-combustion engine (ICE) category. Also, with limited sales of the greens, it is quite challenging and practically unviable to ask our supply chain partners to come to India," a top functionary at a leading European automaker told TOI.EV makers in India import a range of auto components from China and Taiwan, some of which are key elements to make the industry function smoothly."These include lithium-ion battery cells; rare earth magnets; DC Motors; laminated stators; semiconductor chips; printed circuit boards, and electronic child parts, all of which are coming from China," an industry executive said, citing a PwC study on localisation of EV component supply chain in India. "Then you have connectors; contactors; relays, and DC-DC converters which come from China and Taiwan," the executive said.The government launched the PLI scheme in view of the need to reduce exposure to supply chain volatility and drive localisation in the production of EVs. The PWc study emphasises that a strong push from various Government initiatives over the next few years to create an enabling local ecosystem, coupled with the need for EV OEMs to stabilise and control the ever-growing spend on EV components , will drive localisation of the EV supply chain in India.The PLI scheme aims to build 50 GWh of manufacturing capacity with 60% value addition over a period of 5 years. However, the pace at which this capacity grows may be slow due to the high investments required and the complexities involved in cell manufacturing.Localisation has always been a strong mandate for India’s automotive sector due to numerous inherent advantages, the study mentioned, adding that global tensions and COVID-led disruptions in the auto sector have reinforced the need for developing strong local supply chains.The localisation of EV manufacturing in India is particularly challenging due to the nature of components, assembly lines and the available infrastructure in India. As per estimates by PwC, previously non-existent components such as batteries with advanced chemistry, electric motors, power electronics and software now make up at least 50–60% of an EV, most of which are not present in India.Most of the locally manufactured motors are currently relying on Chinese imports for child parts to ensure commercial viability, with limited local value addition in brushless DC (BLDC) motors. While India will have to import rare earth magnets from China, other components such as laminated stators, are also mainly Chinese imports. China and Taiwan control majority of the global supplies of electric components like connectors, contactors, relays and DC-DC convertors, which are important parts of an EV high-voltage circuit.In addition to this, the black box assembly locks in a significant value in EV manufacturing, but is difficult to localise without the support of tier-1 manufacturers or in-house capabilities.India's auto sector continues to rely heavily on Chinese imports, which give rise to volatility and price hikes for the industry. While the government is taking crucial steps to boost localisation of EV production, private players can also play a key role with collaboration and investment to make India an EV superpower.

Dan Hanbury, global equity portfolio manager at Ninety One, which holds Nvidia as its second-largest holding in its global strategic equity fund, cautiously welcomed Nvidia's share price jump in Thursday's premarket trade. "As a holder, it's great to see an early positive reaction but of course as we know those reactions can reverse further into the day," Hanbury told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." "Our reading of the numbers is they are very strong. Clearly, we can get caught up in the quarterly noise of a company like this but if we just put those [numbers] in context … only three years ago they were delivering $15 billion of data center revenue, we're now looking at consensus forecasts into next year of $280 billion," Hanbury said.

Mumbai: India has seen record investments in subsea cable connectivity, with four out of seven major subsea networks now landing in the country, said Carl Grivner, chief executive, FLAG , one of the world's largest independent subsea network operators.FLAG, backed by UK-based private equity firm 3i Group, operates systems linking Mumbai to Singapore, and Chennai to Singapore which entailed total investments of $20 million."We have plans to invest approximately $40 million in several key initiatives and projects, including Indian terrestrial routes, new investments between India to Malaysia/Singapore, and are exploring cable landing party opportunities," Grivner told ET. "In addition to our ILD (international long distance) licence, we're applying to expand our licence footprint to better meet customer demand," he added.As global concerns rise over subsea cable security and redundancy, Grivner stressed the need for diverse and redundant routes to mitigate outages like those in the Red Sea.FLAG plans to diversify its network mix from 90% subsea and 10% terrestrial to 60% subsea and 40% terrestrial in the coming years, building land-based extensions through Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Turkey among markets to bypass volatile maritime zones.Grivner, an infrastructure sector veteran and former CEO of London's Colt Technologies, believes that India's rising middle class and hyperscaler-led data centre boom are fuelling demand for high-capacity, low-latency links."We're talking gigawatts of data centre capacity now, and that demands massive connectivity both within and beyond India," he said.Grivner also urged greater private equity participation in the subsea ecosystem, which could boost efforts by telecom companies and hyperscalers like Google and Meta. FLAG, which plans further investments in India and Asia, is also exploring edge data centres to serve the low-latency demands of AI-driven applications.On policy measures for supporting India's connectivity, Grivner said, "I'm very encouraged to see that the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) has become far more open and progressive in the last four-five years. And I would suggest them to continue opening this market with new participants."FLAG has full ownership of the cables FNAL, FA-1, FEA, HAWK and FALCON, and investments in other India-to- Asia and European paths. FLAG has also made an initial investment in a new Trans-Pacific cable and intends to make further investment announcements in the future, Grivner said.In April this year, FLAG secured a $340 million refinancing deal from Apterra, Barclays, CIBC, DNB, HSBC, NAB, and NatWest to support growth and expansion, including investments in subsea cable network upgrades, edge data centres, and cable landing stations.In December 2024, the company committed $34 million investment to secure new capacity on the India-Asia-Xpress and India-Europe-Xpress cable systems, which also saw an investment from Reliance Jio.

[TITLE]FCC rolls back cybersecurity rules for telcos, despite state-hacking risks:
[TEXT]
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has rolled back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures following the massive hack from the Chinese threat group known as Salt Typhoon.

The ruling came in January 2025 and took effect immediately under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), in response to Salt Typhoon's breaching multiple carriers to spy on private communications.

Along with Section 105 of the CALEA, the declaratory ruling included a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for telecom companies to:

Create and implement cybersecurity risk-management plans

Submit annual FCC certifications proving they were doing so

Treat general network cybersecurity as a legal obligation

Following lobbying from telecommunication firms - according to a letter from Senator Maria Cantwell, that found the new framework too cumbersome and taxing for their operations, the FCC has now deemed the prior rule inflexible, retracting it.

“The Federal Communications Commission today took action to correct course and rescind an unlawful and ineffective prior Declaratory Ruling misconstruing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA),” reads the FCC announcement.

“The Order also withdraws an NPRM that accompanied that Declaratory Ruling, which was based in part on the Declaratory Ruling’s flawed legal analysis and proposed ineffective cybersecurity requirements.”

The FCC, which is now under new leadership, noted that communications service providers have taken important steps to strengthen their cybersecurity posture following the Salt Typhoon incidents, and have agreed to continue along this path in a coordinated manner, reducing risks to national security.

Disclosed in October 2024, the Salt Typhoon attacks were linked to a Chinese espionage campaign that impacted several companies, including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies [1], T-Mobile [2], Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications [3], and Windstream [4].

The hackers accessed core systems that U.S. federal government used for court-authorized network wiretapping requests, and potentially intercepted extremely sensitive information, up to the level of government officials.

FCC's plan met with criticism

Given that the risk for similar hacker operations remains unchanged, the FCC’s latest decision was met with criticism.

Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the only one voting against the current decision, expressed frustration about the reliance on telecom providers for self-evaluating their cybersecurity stance and the effectiveness of the protective measures.

“Its [FCCs] proposed rollback is not a cybersecurity strategy,” stated Gomez. “It is a hope and a dream that will leave Americans less protected than they were the day the Salt Typhoon breach was discovered.”

“Salt Typhoon was not a one-off event but part of a broader campaign by state-sponsored actors to infiltrate telecommunications networks over long periods of time,” Gomez warned in her statement.

“Federal officials have stated publicly that similar reconnaissance and exploitation attempts are ongoing today, and that telecommunications networks remain high-value targets for foreign adversaries,” the official said.

Senators Maria Cantwell and Gary Peters have also sent letters to the FCC before the vote to urge the agency to maintain the cybersecurity safeguards.

BleepingComputer has emailed the FCC for a statement and will update the article when we get a reply.

[TITLE]UK backs next-generation satellite communications with £6.9 million investment:
[TEXT]
The funding will support five groundbreaking projects through the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ARTES (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) programme, part of the Directorate of Connectivity and Secure Communications. These projects showcase British expertise in next-generation satellite technologies and strengthen the UK’s role in advanced communications.

This investment underpins the UK’s Industrial Strategy priority capabilities: Satellite Communications, Position, Navigation and Timing, In-orbit Servicing and Manufacturing, Space Domain Awareness, and Space Data for Earth Applications.

With European demand for satellites up to 2033 forecasted to be worth £40 billion, even 2% of this would bring around £800 million in revenues for the UK economy alone.

Space Minister Liz Lloyd said:

Space technology and especially satellites, are essential to our daily lives. From the sat nav in your car to your mobile phone, from weather forecasts to your online banking – space is where it all happens. By backing our UK sector, we’re not only cementing our position as a European space leader – we’re creating high-skilled jobs, attracting investment, and ensuring space technologies can connect communities to the space-enabled services they need.

The five UK-led projects span critical areas of innovation in satellite communications, from refuelling satellites to extend their lifespans, to developing 5G networks and optical links that will improve global connectivity.

Orbit Fab will deliver the Advancing Satcom Technology with Refuelling and Logistics (ASTRAL) project with a total UK funding of up to £2.9 million. The contract for the first stage of the mission, worth £1.3 million, has now been awarded by ESA. This mission will prove the capability to refuel electric propulsion satellites using UK-developed technology, ensuring satellites can remain in orbit for longer or can manoeuvre away from threats.

Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall will lead the AGILE: Antenna Ground Interface and LunaNet Equipment project, supported by £1.6 million in funding. Amidst the growing number of lunar missions, this project will produce an interface unit that can be installed in global antennas to communicate with spacecraft using the internationally recognised LunaNet specification. This will allow missions to seamlessly connect to ground infrastructure, improving mission success rates.

Vicinity Technologies will receive £1.19 million for its 5G NTN-based Satellite Access Networks project. The team will design and develop a versatile 5G Non-Terrestrial Network regenerative payload system and user terminals, including the entire software stack for both space and ground segments. This technology will support uninterrupted and scalable internet services globally, from hard-to-reach areas to smart cities.

Archangel Lightworks, working with the support of Eutelsat will advance optical communications through the Space Optical Link Integration Study (SOLIS) project, funded with £356,000. This study, delivered under ESA’s Sunrise programme, will investigate use cases for deploying Free Space Optical Communications technology within Eutelsat’s OneWeb LEO global network.

Finally, Inmarsat Navigation Ventures Ltd (Viasat UK) will receive £881,000 for the International Virtual Satellite Operators Network (Phase 2) project. This initiative will develop a service that enables governments to plan, procure, manage and monitor satellite communications services from Viasat and other providers, ensuring secure and coherent management of critical communications.

Dr Paul Bate, CEO of the UK Space Agency, said:

Today’s investment shows how the UK’s space ambitions translate into real-world impact. By advancing satellite communications technology, we’re not only building a globally competitive sector but also ensuring that communities – even in the most remote corners of the UK – can access the services they need. This is space delivering for people and powering our future economy.

By helping businesses, universities and research institutions commercialise breakthrough technologies, the government is creating high-skilled jobs in the UK’s £18.9 billion space sector and delivering tangible benefits - from improved weather forecasting to enhanced national security.

Laurent Jaffart, Director of ESA’s Connectivity and Secure Communications, said:

ESA is committed to supporting a vibrant and striving telecommunications ecosystem in Europe, while achieving a zero-debris environment in space. This milestone, with support from the UK Space Agency, will further strengthen the European autonomy and sovereignty that we are collectively striving for with our Member States.

Dr Colin Baldwin, Executive Director of the UKspace Trade Association, said:

UKspace’s Satellite Telecommunications Committee, run jointly with techUK, has made a strong case that our industry has the expertise, technology and talent to capture a significant portion of the global satellite communications market over the coming decade. We are delighted to see so many of our member companies benefiting from and taking advantage of the UK Space Agency’s investment in the ARTES programme at the ESA Council of Ministers meeting in 2022 continuing to develop new innovations which will help to achieve this goal.

This funding comes ahead of the ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen on 26-27 November, where the Government will negotiate the UK’s investment into the future of Europe’s space ambitions, with a focus on economic growth and national security. Evaluation shows that every £1 invested in ESA returns £7.49 in direct benefits to the UK economy.

As well as ESA programmes, the UK space sector has access to a wider range of national space funding than ever before. To support national programmes and the UK’s membership of ESA, the government allocated the UK Space Agency a budget of £2.8 billion up to 2029/30.

From pioneering satellite refuelling to transforming connectivity in remote areas, these projects show how investment in space delivers real benefits for people’s everyday lives.

[TITLE]AI momentum is real: But what’s in it for investors?:
[TEXT]
The AI train

AI vs dot-com bubble

A slice of AI in your MF

Not all circular deals mislead

Risks are real

Global chip giant Nvidia reported that its revenues had soared 62% to $57 billion in the quarter ending October 2025, and projected sales would climb to $65 billion in the current quarter. Just as investors and sceptics were beginning to doubt the artificial intelligence (AI) run, Nvidia’s robust results appear to have reassured some that the AI momentum is real. The question is, how long can this good run continue?Corporations are also investing heavily in AI. Reports state that Google plans to invest $40 billion, while Oracle has committed $3 billion over the next five years. Bosch, the German multinational engineering and technology company, aims to deploy Euro 2.5 billion by 2027, while Nvidia has outlined plans to invest $10 billion in AI. Indian companies are also placing their bets. L&T recently invested Rs.1,407 crore for a 21% stake in E2E Networks, a firm specialising in AI and data centre development. Tata Elxsi, Zensar Technologies, Affle 3i and Persistent Systems have all announced AI-led strategies.Countries like the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and China have been pouring billions into AI data centres, chips and cloud infrastructure. India is also pursuing AI bets, albeit slowly. The industry believes that AI is the next big thing and no one wants to be late for the party.The excitement is contagious. Asset managers, retail investors and global giants are all convinced that AI will reshape the world. Select Indian mutual fund (MF) schemes have taken a sizeable exposure to the AI theme. Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund has nearly Rs.19,000 crore—around 16% of its portfolio—allocated to AI-linked companies, as per Morningstar. With US indices now having over 30% weight in AI stocks, global exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are mirroring this trend. The Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 ETF allocates more than one-third of its assets to AI stocks, while the Mirae NYSE FANG+ ETF allocates more than half, as of October 2025, according to Morningstar data. Even Warren Buffett’s cautious portfolio has roughly 27% exposure to businesses deeply integrated with AI-led ecosystems, as per a report by Nasdaq.com.Even if AI reshapes the world, is every company riding the wave worthy of the premium it commands today? Oracle is a clear example. Its share price climbed from around $150 to nearly $350 within a year purely on the strength of the AI narrative, before slipping back to the $220 range. AI doesn’t seem like a fad. Or is this irrational exuberance?Some experts are comparing this period to the 2000 dot-com era. There was tremendous optimism, massive capital flows, soaring valuations and little regard for whether demand would catch up. Several MF schemes were launched to capitalise on the Internet theme, some of whose net asset values (NAVs) fell to as low as Rs.2-3 when the theme unravelled. The Internet eventually changed the world, but hundreds of companies collapsed before that happened. In the late 1990s, companies with no customers, no sales, and certainly no profits were fetching rich valuations based purely on website traffic, which they hoped would convert into revenue. When the revenue didn’t come, the entire pack collapsed.Some reckon that today’s AI boom has similar ingredients. Countless startups are being launched, billions are being deployed, and expectations are sky-high. “Billions are being poured into graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI data centres. Everyone’s chasing the future. AI will be the future, but companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and OpenAI might be over-allocating capital to AI,” says Kirtan Shah, Founder and CEO of Truvanta Wealth.Funds with largest volume of AI stocks in their portfolios.Vikas Gupta, CIO, Omniscience Capital, offers a different view: “In the dot-com era, companies didn’t even have revenues. Today’s AI giants make $300-500 billion in revenue and nearly $100 billion in annual cash flows. These are extremely profitable companies.” This alone makes the current cycle very different.Viram Shah, Founder & CEO, Vested Finance, agrees. “These companies are fundamentally strong, with solid earnings and leadership in critical technologies like cloud AI, chips, and generative software,” he says.Even valuations today are nowhere near the extremes of 2000. At the peak of the dot-com bubble, the top technology names traded at around 70 times the two-year forward earnings. In comparison, today’s biggest AI spenders—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta—trade closer to 26-30 times the forward earnings. Higher than normal, but far from bubble territory. Another similarity often highlighted is concentration. Today, the socalled ‘Magnificent Seven’ account for

[TITLE]Amid DIY frenzy, Wealthy’s ₹130-cr fund raise fuels big bet on adviser-led wealth-tech:
[TEXT]
Even as DIY investing apps dominate headlines, a chunk of mutual fund money in India is still routed through human advisers. While popular investing apps such as Zerodha and Groww race to cut out middlemen, there is Wealthy that is making a contrarian, high‑stakes bet on keeping human advisers at the centre of India’s wealth‑technology (wealth‑tech) stack.

The Bengaluru-based startup has raised ₹130 crore in fresh funding, led by Bertelsmann India Investments, to deepen its artificial intelligence (AI)-led platform for mutual fund distributors (MFDs), with participation from existing investor Alphawave Global, new investor Shepherd’s Hill and a clutch of tech entrepreneurs.

Instead of going direct to consumers, Wealthy looks to sell software and AI tools to MFDs—independent mutual fund distributors who still intermediate roughly 80% of India’s retail equity wealth—so they can handle know-your-customer (KYC) checks, compliance and portfolio reviews faster, and sell investment products more efficiently while staying the primary advisers to their clients.

Rising investment flows

Over the past few years, household money flowing into financial assets has been rising steadily. Annual financial savings have climbed from

[TITLE]The Irish Times view on EU tech regulation: trying to strike a difficult balance:
[TEXT]

The European Union has been underpinned by a robust and comprehensive set of regulations since its foundation, which has been one of the main strengths of the Single Market. Any attempt to undermine these rules was usually given short shrift. But over the past few years the EU’s commitment to regulation has become a source of tension with its main trading partners and increasingly from within.

“The EU regulates while the US innovates” has been a popular refrain among senior officials in the Trump administration and at boardroom level among big US tech firms. The European Commission has now unveiled an Omnibus Bill aimed at simplifying regulations covering artificial intelligence, data protection and privacy. The move has prompted criticism, which ranges from industry groups accusing the Commission of not going far enough to a coalition of NGOs claiming Brussels has caved in to pressure from the US.

In reality, much of the pressure on the Commission was coming from closer to home. Mario Draghi, the former Italian Prime Minister, compiled a report into European competitiveness, which was published in September 2024. He recommended a series of far-reaching reforms across the digital economy, amid concerns the EU was falling behind the US and China in AI.

The EU had introduced one of the world’s first attempts to regulate AI through an AI Act in July 2024. The rationale for the Bill was that it would provide a solid regulatory framework that would enable investment in AI to flourish. The reality has been somewhat different. The Omnibus Bill has pared back and delayed the introduction of many provisions in the AI Act. The Bill also proposes the sweeping simplification of rules relating to data collection and privacy.

It will take time to judge whether the Bill has the desired effect of boosting innovation and investment while at the same time protecting EU citizens. However it is a welcome step to achieve these aims, even if the rapid evolution of this area is likely to require more to be done in the years ahead.
