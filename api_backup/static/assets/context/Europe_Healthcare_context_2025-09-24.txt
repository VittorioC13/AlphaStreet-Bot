G1090N in ACLF: safety data (healthy volunteers) and markers of efficacy expected by end 2025

Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), (Zurich, Switzerland); September 22, 2025 – GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today announced its first half 2025 financial results and provided a corporate update.

Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “Although our recent discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF was disappointing news, it was the right decision for patients. Since we embarked in ACLF, we have engaged with many healthcare professionals, regulators, and patient associations, and we’re more convinced than ever by the importance of developing novel therapeutic options in this underserved indication. Of course, risk is inherent to drug development, but we mitigate it with six programs underway, and two data sets expected by the end of the year. Following the discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will extend projected cash runway beyond 2028 and offer optionality as we continue to explore new mechanistic approaches to tackle the multiple dimensions of ACLF care.”

I. 1H25 Business highlights and main events after the reporting period2

Acute on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF): Discontinuation of VS-01 program, refocused on UCD

On September 19, 2025, GENFIT announced its decision to discontinue its VS-01 program in ACLF, and reprioritize its development on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD):

GENFIT’s decision followed the occurrence of a peritonitis case reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the UNVEIL-IT® clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in patients with ACLF grade 1, 2 or 3a and ascites and subsequent review and feedback from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study, GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites.

GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD, a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition, patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication, and based on ammonia clearance data, we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.

GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need, with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area, we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication, together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context, we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF, which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results, as we move forward, starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N, expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015, CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.

Earlier in May 2025, GENFIT participated at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Congress 2025 with several posters presenting its latest progress in ACLF. The congress highlighted the growing importance of ACLF within the hepatology community.

PBC: new milestone payment, encouraging sales performance of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by our partner Ipsen and withdrawal of key competitor in the US market

In May 2025, Ipsen’s Iqirvo® (elafibranor) was granted pricing and reimbursement in Italy for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). This major step unlocked a new €26.5 million milestone payment under our Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen, due upon pricing and reimbursement of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets.3

In July 2025, Ipsen reported “accelerated sales growth of €59m in the first half of 2025 in the U.S. and in Europe (mainly Germany & the U.K.) driven by increasing uptake from new patients, switch and market expansion sales for Iqirvo® 4”.

In September 2025, Intercept Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned biopharmaceutical subsidiary of Alfasigma S.p.A., announced its decision to withdraw OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid) from the US market for the treatment of PBC.5 This decision followed a request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We expect this to create a market dynamic that should support the sales trajectory of Iqirvo® by our partner Ipsen.

PSC: positive late-breaking Phase 2 data for elafibranor presented by Ipsen at EASL Congress 2025

In May 2025, Ipsen presented data from its late-breaking abstract on elafibranor, highlighting favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Should elafibranor be approved in a second indication after PBC, GENFIT would also be eligible for milestone payments and royalties under the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen.

CCA: acquisition of full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma

In early 2025, GENFIT completed the acquisition of the full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma, expanding upon the limited rights initially obtained through a license at the end of 2021. GENFIT acquired all patents and patent applications, know-how, and data held by Genoscience Pharma necessary for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of GNS561 worldwide.*

Financing: Closing of royalty financing agreement with HCRx significantly extends cash runway

The Royalty Financing6 agreement signed in March 2025 has significantly extended GENFIT’s cash runway, beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled 7 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

Corporate governance updates

Following the retirement of Chief Medical Officer Carol Addy on June 30, 2025, a new CMO has been appointed and will officially assume the role at the end of the year.

Chief Scientific Officer Dean Hum will retire, effective as of September 30, 2025. He will be replaced by Sakina Sayah-Jeanne, currently EVP Research & Translational Science and member of the Executive Committee since she joined GENFIT in 2023. Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “I’m delighted to officially welcome Sakina as our new Chief Scientific Officer. Having already demonstrated outstanding leadership since she joined GENFIT, she is uniquely positioned to guide our scientific strategy and execute on the plan. And on behalf of everyone at GENFIT, I want to thank Dean for his considerable contribution since GENFIT’s inception in 1999. Dean has been instrumental over the years in moving our programs forward, including elafibranor in PBC. As Dean transitions into retirement, we are grateful that he will remain active as advisor, continuing to share his expertise.”

At the June 2025 Annual Meeting, Mr. Tristan Imbert was appointed by our shareholders as director for a three-year term and joined the Audit Committee and ESG Committee.

Extra-financial performance

In May 2025, GENFIT published its annual Extra-Financial Performance Report (fiscal year 2024), highlighting its latest initiatives and providing insights on the evolution of key performance indicators. In terms of recognition, ISS ESG increased our rating from C+ to B- maintaining our “Prime status”.

II. 2H25 and beyond: key milestones and outlook

ACLF pipeline

G1090N – Safety data and early markers of efficacy are expected by the end of 2025, and will serve to optimize the design of the proof-of-concept study targeted to start in the first half of 2026, with the objective to generate efficacy data by the end of 2026.

SRT-015 – Current work on an improved formulation aims at increasing exposure. Pending positive development, the launch of a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

CLM-022 – Current experiments aim at confirming therapeutic efficacy using different disease models relevant for AD and ACLF as well as starting formulation development and first toxicological studies in 2025. Pending further positive developments, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the first half of 2027.

VS-02-HE – We intend to develop VS-02-HE as a unique oral formulation designed to act in the gut where ammonia is primarily produced, minimizing systemic absorption of ammonia while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. Completion of Investigational New Drug-enabling nonclinical studies and formulation development are expected by the end of 2025. Pending further confirmation, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the second half of 2027.

Other life-threatening diseases

GNS561 in CCA – Data readout from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial are expected by the end of 2025.

VS-01-HAC (pediatric indication) – Following feedback from the FDA (U.S.) and PDCO8 (Europe), the pivotal juvenile toxicology study in Göttingen Minipigs started and data are expected before the end of 2025. Following discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, additional preclinical work will be conducted before moving into the clinic. Depending on the outcome of preclinical work, a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

III. 1H25 Financial highlights

Cash and cash equivalents

As of June 30, 2025, GENFIT had €107.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with €81.8 million as of December 31, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 exclude the milestone payment of €26.5 million invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025), following the approval of pricing and reimbursement for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled9 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

In the first half of 2025, cash utilization mainly stems from our research and development efforts, notably UNVEIL-IT®, our Phase 2 clinical trial of VS-01 in ACLF (and related proof-of-concept study); GNS561, as part of its Cholangiocarcinoma program; NTZ, as part of its ACLF program; SRT-015, as part of its ACLF program; and CLM-22, as part of its ACLF program.

Revenues and other income

Revenues and other income amounted to €35.7 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €61.2 million in the first half of 2024.

Substantially all revenue is attributable to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Ipsen in 2025, including i) royalty revenue from worldwide sales (excluding Greater China) of Ipsen's Iqirvo® (elafibranor) totaling €6.9 million and ii) milestone revenue from pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries totaling €26.5 million.

Operating expenses

Operating expenses amounted to €35.6 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €30.0 million in the first half of 2024).

Substantially all of the increase in operating expenses is due to research and development expenses, which amounted to €25.1 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €19.0 million in the first half of 2024). Specifically, there was increased spending related to contracting costs, which amounted to €13.4 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €7.8 million in the first half of 2024), primarily reflecting increased activities related to VS-01 in ACLF .

Financial results

For the half-year ended June 30, 2025, financial income amounted to a loss of €10.2 million, compared to a loss of €0.9 million for the same period in 2024. The increase relates to debt issuance costs and financial charges from the Royalty Financing agreement.

Net loss

The first half of 2025 resulted in a net loss of €10.0 million, compared with a net profit of €30.3 million in the first half of 2024.

[TITLE]Trump Victory: Pharma Giant Launches Drug at Same Price in U.S., Europe:
[TEXT]
U.S. pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) announced Monday its new flagship drug will launch at the same price overseas in the UK as in the U.S., a precedent-breaking move reflecting President Donald Trump’s push to end higher drug costs for Americans.

BMS will launch schizophrenia drug Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) in the United Kingdom in 2026 at a list price equal to that in the U.S. The move makes BMS the first to align U.S. and overseas pricing in a huge victory for Trump that validates his push to force change in the industry to end “foreign free-riding.”

“We agree with the Trump Administration that other countries need to pay their fair share,” said Adam Lenkowsky, Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “By making this commitment, we are asking the UK to step up in recognizing the value of truly innovative therapies.”

Trump announced in May that he would sign an executive order on drug pricing to “do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years.”

“For many years the World has wondered why” prescription and pharmaceutical drugs are so much more expensive in the U.S. than they are “in any other nation,” Trump pointed out in a Truth Social post in May, adding that sometimes they are “five to ten times more expensive than the same drug, manufactured in the exact same laboratory or plant, by the same company.”

“I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’s POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,” he announced, predicting “Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%.”

After the EO was signed, Breitbart News Economics Editor John Carney called Trump’s move “a starting point” and “a long-overdue assertion of national interest in a sector that has for too long been shielded from scrutiny.”

“Its success will depend on implementation, legal resilience, and follow-through in negotiations,” he wrote for Breitbart Business Digest in May. “But the principle it asserts is clear and long overdue: Americans should not be forced to overpay for medicine so that foreign governments can underpay.”

Monday’s announcement is good news for patients who have long borne the burden of higher U.S. drug prices.

Trump has long prioritized the issue. In an interview in September, he told Fox, “for years, we’ve been paying sometimes for a pill, $100, and [other countries] are paying $10 … We’re going to be reducing drug costs over the next year, year and a half,” calling his predicted developments “a monumental change in healthcare.”

Carney explained that the discrepancy in prices in the U.S. and overseas is “because every other developed country uses some form of centralized price negotiation or regulation. The U.S. stands virtually alone in letting manufacturers name their price — then requires insurance plans, public and private alike, to cover those products.”

“That is not a market. That is a racket.”

Guy Oliver, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb UK, acknowledged those challenges, as well as the need for the UK government to come to the table — a move it would not have made without Trump’s prodding.

“Despite the UK’s challenging commercial environment, we are committed to working with the NHS, NICE and other authorities to make this medicine available to all eligible UK patients,” he said. “However, to enable us to achieve this goal, a new approach is needed. We therefore call on the Government to collaborate with the life sciences sector to increase investment in new medicines and fully recognise the value that innovation brings to patients, society, and the UK’s long-term prosperity.”

Importantly, BMS is willing to walk away from the U.K. market if regulatory agencies refuse to purchase the drug at the same pricing offered in the U.S.

“Our intention is to work with the UK health authorities to make this medicine available, but we are prepared to make the difficult decision to walk away if they cannot better recognize the value our medicine brings to patients and society,” Lenkowsky said.

In terms of recognition, ISS ESG increased our rating from C+ to B- maintaining our “Prime status”.

II. 2H25 and beyond: key milestones and outlook

ACLF pipeline

G1090N – Safety data and early markers of efficacy are expected by the end of 2025, and will serve to optimize the design of the proof-of-concept study targeted to start in the first half of 2026, with the objective to generate efficacy data by the end of 2026.

SRT-015 – Current work on an improved formulation aims at increasing exposure. Pending positive development, the launch of a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

CLM-022 – Current experiments aim at confirming therapeutic efficacy using different disease models relevant for AD and ACLF as well as starting formulation development and first toxicological studies in 2025. Pending further positive developments, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the first half of 2027.

VS-02-HE – We intend to develop VS-02-HE as a unique oral formulation designed to act in the gut where ammonia is primarily produced, minimizing systemic absorption of ammonia while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. Completion of Investigational New Drug-enabling nonclinical studies and formulation development are expected by the end of 2025. Pending further confirmation, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the second half of 2027.

Other life-threatening diseases

GNS561 in CCA – Data readout from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial are expected by the end of 2025.

VS-01-HAC (pediatric indication) – Following feedback from the FDA (U.S.) and PDCO8 (Europe), the pivotal juvenile toxicology study in Göttingen Minipigs started and data are expected before the end of 2025. Following discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, additional preclinical work will be conducted before moving into the clinic. Depending on the outcome of preclinical work, a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

III. 1H25 Financial highlights

Cash and cash equivalents

As of June 30, 2025, GENFIT had €107.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with €81.8 million as of December 31, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 exclude the milestone payment of €26.5 million invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025), following the approval of pricing and reimbursement for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled9 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

In the first half of 2025, cash utilization mainly stems from our research and development efforts, notably UNVEIL-IT®, our Phase 2 clinical trial of VS-01 in ACLF (and related proof-of-concept study); GNS561, as part of its Cholangiocarcinoma program; NTZ, as part of its ACLF program; SRT-015, as part of its ACLF program; and CLM-22, as part of its ACLF program.

Revenues and other income

Revenues and other income amounted to €35.7 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €61.2 million in the first half of 2024.

Substantially all revenue is attributable to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Ipsen in 2025, including i) royalty revenue from worldwide sales (excluding Greater China) of Ipsen's Iqirvo® (elafibranor) totaling €6.9 million and ii) milestone revenue from pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries totaling €26.5 million.

Operating expenses

Operating expenses amounted to €35.6 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €30.0 million in the first half of 2024).

Substantially all of the increase in operating expenses is due to research and development expenses, which amounted to €25.1 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €19.0 million in the first half of 2024). Specifically, there was increased spending related to contracting costs, which amounted to €13.4 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €7.8 million in the first half of 2024), primarily reflecting increased activities related to VS-01 in ACLF .

Financial results

For the half-year ended June 30, 2025, financial income amounted to a loss of €10.2 million, compared to a loss of €0.9 million for the same period in 2024. The increase relates to debt issuance costs and financial charges from the Royalty Financing agreement.

Net loss

The first half of 2025 resulted in a net loss of €10.0 million, compared with a net profit of €30.3 million in the first half of 2024.

[TITLE]GENFIT Reports First-Half 2025 Financial Results and:
[TEXT]
Cash and cash equivalents totaled €107.5 million as of June 30, 2025, excluding the €26.5 million milestone invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025) upon pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European countries

€33.5 million in revenues, including the €26.5 million milestone invoiced in May 2025

Strong 1H25 sales trajectory reported by Ipsen for Iqirvo® in PBC in July, followed by U.S. market exit of key competitor in September

Following discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF announced last week, cash runway projected to extend beyond 2028 1 , offering optionality for business development initiatives

GNS561 in CCA: Phase 1b data expected by end of 2025

G1090N in ACLF: safety data (healthy volunteers) and markers of efficacy expected by end 2025

Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), (Zurich, Switzerland); September 22, 2025 – GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today announced its first half 2025 financial results and provided a corporate update.

Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “Although our recent discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF was disappointing news, it was the right decision for patients. Since we embarked in ACLF, we have engaged with many healthcare professionals, regulators, and patient associations, and we’re more convinced than ever by the importance of developing novel therapeutic options in this underserved indication. Of course, risk is inherent to drug development, but we mitigate it with six programs underway, and two data sets expected by the end of the year. Following the discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will extend projected cash runway beyond 2028 and offer optionality as we continue to explore new mechanistic approaches to tackle the multiple dimensions of ACLF care.”

I. 1H25 Business highlights and main events after the reporting period2

Acute on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF): Discontinuation of VS-01 program, refocused on UCD

On September 19, 2025, GENFIT announced its decision to discontinue its VS-01 program in ACLF, and reprioritize its development on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD):

GENFIT’s decision followed the occurrence of a peritonitis case reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the UNVEIL-IT® clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in patients with ACLF grade 1, 2 or 3a and ascites and subsequent review and feedback from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study, GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites.

GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD, a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition, patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication, and based on ammonia clearance data, we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.

GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need, with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area, we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication, together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context, we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF, which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results, as we move forward, starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N, expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015, CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.

Earlier in May 2025, GENFIT participated at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Congress 2025 with several posters presenting its latest progress in ACLF. The congress highlighted the growing importance of ACLF within the hepatology community.

PBC: new milestone payment, encouraging sales performance of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by our partner Ipsen and withdrawal of key competitor in the US market

In May 2025, Ipsen’s Iqirvo® (elafibranor) was granted pricing and reimbursement in Italy for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). This major step unlocked a new €26.5 million milestone payment under our Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen, due upon pricing and reimbursement of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets.3

In July 2025, Ipsen reported “accelerated sales growth of €59m in the first half of 2025 in the U.S. and in Europe (mainly Germany & the U.K.) driven by increasing uptake from new patients, switch and market expansion sales for Iqirvo® 4”.

In September 2025, Intercept Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned biopharmaceutical subsidiary of Alfasigma S.p.A., announced its decision to withdraw OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid) from the US market for the treatment of PBC.5 This decision followed a request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We expect this to create a market dynamic that should support the sales trajectory of Iqirvo® by our partner Ipsen.

PSC: positive late-breaking Phase 2 data for elafibranor presented by Ipsen at EASL Congress 2025

In May 2025, Ipsen presented data from its late-breaking abstract on elafibranor, highlighting favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Should elafibranor be approved in a second indication after PBC, GENFIT would also be eligible for milestone payments and royalties under the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen.

CCA: acquisition of full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma

In early 2025, GENFIT completed the acquisition of the full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma, expanding upon the limited rights initially obtained through a license at the end of 2021. GENFIT acquired all patents and patent applications, know-how, and data held by Genoscience Pharma necessary for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of GNS561 worldwide.*

Financing: Closing of royalty financing agreement with HCRx significantly extends cash runway

The Royalty Financing6 agreement signed in March 2025 has significantly extended GENFIT’s cash runway, beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled 7 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

Corporate governance updates

Following the retirement of Chief Medical Officer Carol Addy on June 30, 2025, a new CMO has been appointed and will officially assume the role at the end of the year.

Chief Scientific Officer Dean Hum will retire, effective as of September 30, 2025. He will be replaced by Sakina Sayah-Jeanne, currently EVP Research & Translational Science and member of the Executive Committee since she joined GENFIT in 2023. Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “I’m delighted to officially welcome Sakina as our new Chief Scientific Officer. Having already demonstrated outstanding leadership since she joined GENFIT, she is uniquely positioned to guide our scientific strategy and execute on the plan. And on behalf of everyone at GENFIT, I want to thank Dean for his considerable contribution since GENFIT’s inception in 1999. Dean has been instrumental over the years in moving our programs forward, including elafibranor in PBC. As Dean transitions into retirement, we are grateful that he will remain active as advisor, continuing to share his expertise.”

At the June 2025 Annual Meeting, Mr. Tristan Imbert was appointed by our shareholders as director for a three-year term and joined the Audit Committee and ESG Committee.

Extra-financial performance

In May 2025, GENFIT published its annual Extra-Financial Performance Report (fiscal year 2024), highlighting its latest initiatives and providing insights on the evolution of key performance indicators. In terms of recognition, ISS ESG increased our rating from C+ to B- maintaining our “Prime status”.

, a pre-clinical investigational novel compound with broad potential to treat brain health diseases, excluding the Republic of Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan Sovargen receives upfront payment and is eligible for future milestone-dependent payments and royalties

Agreement further expands Angelini Pharma’s strong portfolio and deep therapeutic expertise in brain health, following a series of strategic partnerships in the space, including in orphan and rare epilepsy

ROME, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Angelini Pharma, part of the privately owned Angelini Industries, and Sovargen, a South-Korean biotechnology company, announced today that they signed an exclusive global option agreement for the development and commercialization of Sovargen’s innovative brain health asset SVG105.

Under the terms of the agreement, Angelini Pharma and Sovargen will collaboratively lead the pre-clinical development efforts for SVG105 and, following an initial option period, Angelini Pharma will have the right to advance the compound into clinical development and commercialization outside of the Republic of Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. SVG105 is a potentially first-in-class anti-sense oligonucleotide technology to target mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathways. mTOR is a genetically validated target for a number of brain health disorders, including drug-resistant childhood epilepsy.i

Sovargen will receive an upfront payment and will also be eligible to receive additional payments upon pre-defined development and commercial milestones of up to approx. US$550 million, as well as tiered royalties on post-approval net sales.

The announcement follows a number of strategic acquisitions and collaboration agreements that Angelini Pharma has entered over the course of the past two years, which have bolstered the company’s pipeline in brain health, adding to its strong portfolio in the space through sustained investment. In May 2025, Angelini Pharma and GRIN Therapeutics Inc. announced a collaboration for the development and commercialization rights outside of North America for radiprodil, an investigational drug currently being studied in multiple rare genetic epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders. A few days earlier, the company signed an asset purchase and assignment agreement for the development and commercialization of OmniAb’s innovative preclinical asset RO’599, a novel preclinical-stage investigational compound with broad potential to treat various brain health diseases. Last year, Angelini Pharma entered into a strategic partnership with Cureverse, a Korean spin-off of the Korean Institute of Science and Technology, which is developing small molecules with broad CNS applications. In 2023, the company partnered with JCR Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese biotech company with a breakthrough blood-brain barrier technology based on a transferrin receptor mechanism, allowing biologics to cross the barrier. Consequently, Angelini’s brain health pipeline now includes diversified and modern therapeutic modalities ranging from innovative small molecule compounds to biologics and anti-sense oligonucleotides.

“This partnership with Sovargen further solidifies Angelini Pharma’s leading role in the field of brain health, adding additional breadth to our robust portfolio and pipeline,” said Jacopo Andreose, Chief Executive Officer of Angelini Pharma. “Neurological disorders like epilepsy are major contributors to global disease challenges.ii For example, many people living with epilepsy are still unable to reach seizure control despite combination treatment of several anti-seizure medications.iii Our work on SVG105 will be motivated by the ambition to bring much-needed solutions to people living with brain health conditions across the world.”

“We are incredibly excited

Agreement further expands Angelini Pharma’s strong portfolio and deep therapeutic expertise in brain health, following a series of strategic partnerships in the space, including in orphan and rare epilepsy

ROME, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Angelini Pharma, part of the privately owned Angelini Industries, and Sovargen, a South-Korean biotechnology company, announced today that they signed an exclusive global option agreement for the development and commercialization of Sovargen’s innovative brain health asset SVG105.

Under the terms of the agreement, Angelini Pharma and Sovargen will collaboratively lead the pre-clinical development efforts for SVG105 and, following an initial option period, Angelini Pharma will have the right to advance the compound into clinical development and commercialization outside of the Republic of Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. SVG105 is a potentially first-in-class anti-sense oligonucleotide technology to target mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathways. mTOR is a genetically validated target for a number of brain health disorders, including drug-resistant childhood epilepsy.i

Sovargen will receive an upfront payment and will also be eligible to receive additional payments upon pre-defined development and commercial milestones of up to approx. US$550 million, as well as tiered royalties on post-approval net sales.

The announcement follows a number of strategic acquisitions and collaboration agreements that Angelini Pharma has entered over the course of the past two years, which have bolstered the company’s pipeline in brain health, adding to its strong portfolio in the space through sustained investment. In May 2025, Angelini Pharma and GRIN Therapeutics Inc. announced a collaboration for the development and commercialization rights outside of North America for radiprodil, an investigational drug currently being studied in multiple rare genetic epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders. A few days earlier, the company signed an asset purchase and assignment agreement for the development and commercialization of OmniAb’s innovative preclinical asset RO’599, a novel preclinical-stage investigational compound with broad potential to treat various brain health diseases. Last year, Angelini Pharma entered into a strategic partnership with Cureverse, a Korean spin-off of the Korean Institute of Science and Technology, which is developing small molecules with broad CNS applications. In 2023, the company partnered with JCR Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese biotech company with a breakthrough blood-brain barrier technology based on a transferrin receptor mechanism, allowing biologics to cross the barrier. Consequently, Angelini’s brain health pipeline now includes diversified and modern therapeutic modalities ranging from innovative small molecule compounds to biologics and anti-sense oligonucleotides.

“This partnership with Sovargen further solidifies Angelini Pharma’s leading role in the field of brain health, adding additional breadth to our robust portfolio and pipeline,” said Jacopo Andreose, Chief Executive Officer of Angelini Pharma. “Neurological disorders like epilepsy are major contributors to global disease challenges.ii For example, many people living with epilepsy are still unable to reach seizure control despite combination treatment of several anti-seizure medications.iii Our work on SVG105 will be motivated by the ambition to bring much-needed solutions to people living with brain health conditions across the world.”

“We are incredibly excited

[TITLE]Trump Victory: Pharma Giant Launches Drug at Same Price in U.S., Europe:
[TEXT]
U.S. pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) announced Monday its new flagship drug will launch at the same price overseas in the UK as in the U.S., a precedent-breaking move reflecting President Donald Trump’s push to end higher drug costs for Americans.

BMS will launch schizophrenia drug Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) in the United Kingdom in 2026 at a list price equal to that in the U.S. The move makes BMS the first to align U.S. and overseas pricing in a huge victory for Trump that validates his push to force change in the industry to end “foreign free-riding.”

“We agree with the Trump Administration that other countries need to pay their fair share,” said Adam Lenkowsky, Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “By making this commitment, we are asking the UK to step up in recognizing the value of truly innovative therapies.”

Trump announced in May that he would sign an executive order on drug pricing to “do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years.”

“For many years the World has wondered why” prescription and pharmaceutical drugs are so much more expensive in the U.S. than they are “in any other nation,” Trump pointed out in a Truth Social post in May, adding that sometimes they are “five to ten times more expensive than the same drug, manufactured in the exact same laboratory or plant, by the same company.”

“I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’s POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,” he announced, predicting “Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%.”

After the EO was signed, Breitbart News Economics Editor John Carney called Trump’s move “a starting point” and “a long-overdue assertion of national interest in a sector that has for too long been shielded from scrutiny.”

“Its success will depend on implementation, legal resilience, and follow-through in negotiations,” he wrote for Breitbart Business Digest in May. “But the principle it asserts is clear and long overdue: Americans should not be forced to overpay for medicine so that foreign governments can underpay.”

Monday’s announcement is good news for patients who have long borne the burden of higher U.S. drug prices.

Trump has long prioritized the issue. In an interview in September, he told Fox, “for years, we’ve been paying sometimes for a pill, $100, and [other countries] are paying $10 … We’re going to be reducing drug costs over the next year, year and a half,” calling his predicted developments “a monumental change in healthcare.”

Carney explained that the discrepancy in prices in the U.S. and overseas is “because every other developed country uses some form of centralized price negotiation or regulation. The U.S. stands virtually alone in letting manufacturers name their price — then requires insurance plans, public and private alike, to cover those products.”

“That is not a market. That is a racket.”

Guy Oliver, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb UK, acknowledged those challenges, as well as the need for the UK government to come to the table — a move it would not have made without Trump’s prodding.

“Despite the UK’s challenging commercial environment, we are committed to working with the NHS, NICE and other authorities to make this medicine available to all eligible UK patients,” he said. “However, to enable us to achieve this goal, a new approach is needed. We therefore call on the Government to collaborate with the life sciences sector to increase investment in new medicines and fully recognise the value that innovation brings to patients, society, and the UK’s long-term prosperity.”

Importantly, BMS is willing to walk away from the U.K. market if regulatory agencies refuse to purchase the drug at the same pricing offered in the U.S.

“Our intention is to work with the UK health authorities to make this medicine available, but we are prepared to make the difficult decision to walk away if they cannot better recognize the value our medicine brings to patients and society,” Lenkowsky said.

[TITLE]GENFIT Reports First-Half 2025 Financial Results and:
[TEXT]
Cash and cash equivalents totaled €107.5 million as of June 30, 2025, excluding the €26.5 million milestone invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025) upon pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European countries

€33.5 million in revenues, including the €26.5 million milestone invoiced in May 2025

Strong 1H25 sales trajectory reported by Ipsen for Iqirvo® in PBC in July, followed by U.S. market exit of key competitor in September

Following discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF announced last week, cash runway projected to extend beyond 2028 1 , offering optionality for business development initiatives

GNS561 in CCA: Phase 1b data expected by end of 2025

G1090N in ACLF: safety data (healthy volunteers) and markers of efficacy expected by end 2025

Lille (France), Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States), (Zurich, Switzerland); September 22, 2025 – GENFIT (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and life-threatening liver diseases, today announced its first half 2025 financial results and provided a corporate update.

Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “Although our recent discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF was disappointing news, it was the right decision for patients. Since we embarked in ACLF, we have engaged with many healthcare professionals, regulators, and patient associations, and we’re more convinced than ever by the importance of developing novel therapeutic options in this underserved indication. Of course, risk is inherent to drug development, but we mitigate it with six programs underway, and two data sets expected by the end of the year. Following the discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will extend projected cash runway beyond 2028 and offer optionality as we continue to explore new mechanistic approaches to tackle the multiple dimensions of ACLF care.”

I. 1H25 Business highlights and main events after the reporting period2

Acute on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF): Discontinuation of VS-01 program, refocused on UCD

On September 19, 2025, GENFIT announced its decision to discontinue its VS-01 program in ACLF, and reprioritize its development on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD):

GENFIT’s decision followed the occurrence of a peritonitis case reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the UNVEIL-IT® clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in patients with ACLF grade 1, 2 or 3a and ascites and subsequent review and feedback from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study, GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites.

GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD, a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition, patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication, and based on ammonia clearance data, we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.

GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need, with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area, we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication, together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context, we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF, which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results, as we move forward, starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N, expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015, CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.

Earlier in May 2025, GENFIT participated at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Congress 2025 with several posters presenting its latest progress in ACLF. The congress highlighted the growing importance of ACLF within the hepatology community.

PBC: new milestone payment, encouraging sales performance of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by our partner Ipsen and withdrawal of key competitor in the US market

In May 2025, Ipsen’s Iqirvo® (elafibranor) was granted pricing and reimbursement in Italy for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). This major step unlocked a new €26.5 million milestone payment under our Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen, due upon pricing and reimbursement of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets.3

In July 2025, Ipsen reported “accelerated sales growth of €59m in the first half of 2025 in the U.S. and in Europe (mainly Germany & the U.K.) driven by increasing uptake from new patients, switch and market expansion sales for Iqirvo® 4”.

In September 2025, Intercept Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned biopharmaceutical subsidiary of Alfasigma S.p.A., announced its decision to withdraw OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid) from the US market for the treatment of PBC.5 This decision followed a request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We expect this to create a market dynamic that should support the sales trajectory of Iqirvo® by our partner Ipsen.

PSC: positive late-breaking Phase 2 data for elafibranor presented by Ipsen at EASL Congress 2025

In May 2025, Ipsen presented data from its late-breaking abstract on elafibranor, highlighting favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Should elafibranor be approved in a second indication after PBC, GENFIT would also be eligible for milestone payments and royalties under the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen.

CCA: acquisition of full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma

In early 2025, GENFIT completed the acquisition of the full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma, expanding upon the limited rights initially obtained through a license at the end of 2021. GENFIT acquired all patents and patent applications, know-how, and data held by Genoscience Pharma necessary for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of GNS561 worldwide.*

Financing: Closing of royalty financing agreement with HCRx significantly extends cash runway

The Royalty Financing6 agreement signed in March 2025 has significantly extended GENFIT’s cash runway, beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled 7 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

Corporate governance updates

Following the retirement of Chief Medical Officer Carol Addy on June 30, 2025, a new CMO has been appointed and will officially assume the role at the end of the year.

Chief Scientific Officer Dean Hum will retire, effective as of September 30, 2025. He will be replaced by Sakina Sayah-Jeanne, currently EVP Research & Translational Science and member of the Executive Committee since she joined GENFIT in 2023. Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented: “I’m delighted to officially welcome Sakina as our new Chief Scientific Officer. Having already demonstrated outstanding leadership since she joined GENFIT, she is uniquely positioned to guide our scientific strategy and execute on the plan. And on behalf of everyone at GENFIT, I want to thank Dean for his considerable contribution since GENFIT’s inception in 1999. Dean has been instrumental over the years in moving our programs forward, including elafibranor in PBC. As Dean transitions into retirement, we are grateful that he will remain active as advisor, continuing to share his expertise.”

At the June 2025 Annual Meeting, Mr. Tristan Imbert was appointed by our shareholders as director for a three-year term and joined the Audit Committee and ESG Committee.

Extra-financial performance

In May 2025, GENFIT published its annual Extra-Financial Performance Report (fiscal year 2024), highlighting its latest initiatives and providing insights on the evolution of key performance indicators. In terms of recognition, ISS ESG increased our rating from C+ to B- maintaining our “Prime status”.

II. 2H25 and beyond: key milestones and outlook

ACLF pipeline

G1090N – Safety data and early markers of efficacy are expected by the end of 2025, and will serve to optimize the design of the proof-of-concept study targeted to start in the first half of 2026, with the objective to generate efficacy data by the end of 2026.

SRT-015 – Current work on an improved formulation aims at increasing exposure. Pending positive development, the launch of a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

CLM-022 – Current experiments aim at confirming therapeutic efficacy using different disease models relevant for AD and ACLF as well as starting formulation development and first toxicological studies in 2025. Pending further positive developments, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the first half of 2027.

VS-02-HE – We intend to develop VS-02-HE as a unique oral formulation designed to act in the gut where ammonia is primarily produced, minimizing systemic absorption of ammonia while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. Completion of Investigational New Drug-enabling nonclinical studies and formulation development are expected by the end of 2025. Pending further confirmation, a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the second half of 2027.

Other life-threatening diseases

GNS561 in CCA – Data readout from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial are expected by the end of 2025.

VS-01-HAC (pediatric indication) – Following feedback from the FDA (U.S.) and PDCO8 (Europe), the pivotal juvenile toxicology study in Göttingen Minipigs started and data are expected before the end of 2025. Following discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF, additional preclinical work will be conducted before moving into the clinic. Depending on the outcome of preclinical work, a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.

III. 1H25 Financial highlights

Cash and cash equivalents

As of June 30, 2025, GENFIT had €107.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with €81.8 million as of December 31, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 exclude the milestone payment of €26.5 million invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025), following the approval of pricing and reimbursement for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond the end of 2028, enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds, ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing, and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled9 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.

In the first half of 2025, cash utilization mainly stems from our research and development efforts, notably UNVEIL-IT®, our Phase 2 clinical trial of VS-01 in ACLF (and related proof-of-concept study); GNS561, as part of its Cholangiocarcinoma program; NTZ, as part of its ACLF program; SRT-015, as part of its ACLF program; and CLM-22, as part of its ACLF program.

Revenues and other income

Revenues and other income amounted to €35.7 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €61.2 million in the first half of 2024.

Substantially all revenue is attributable to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Ipsen in 2025, including i) royalty revenue from worldwide sales (excluding Greater China) of Ipsen's Iqirvo® (elafibranor) totaling €6.9 million and ii) milestone revenue from pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries totaling €26.5 million.

Operating expenses

Operating expenses amounted to €35.6 million in the first half of 2025, compared to €30.0 million in the first half of 2024).

Substantially all of the increase in operating expenses is due to research and development expenses, which amounted to €25.1 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €19.0 million in the first half of 2024). Specifically, there was increased spending related to contracting costs, which amounted to €13.4 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €7.8 million in the first half of 2024), primarily reflecting increased activities related to VS-01 in ACLF .

Financial results

For the half-year ended June 30, 2025, financial income amounted to a loss of €10.2 million, compared to a loss of €0.9 million for the same period in 2024. The increase relates to debt issuance costs and financial charges from the Royalty Financing agreement.

Net loss

The first half of 2025 resulted in a net loss of €10.0 million, compared with a net profit of €30.3 million in the first half of 2024.
