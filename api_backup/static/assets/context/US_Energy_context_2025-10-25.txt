[TITLE]Oil Prices May Stabilise As Key OPEC Member Says Cartel May Raise Supply Post US Sanctions On Russia:
[TEXT]
OPEC is prepared to raise production further by rolling back its oil output cuts if necessary to address any market shortfall after the US imposed new sanctions on major Russian oil firms, Kuwait’s oil minister said on Thursday.

“I expect that any decision to impose sanctions will certainly have a positive impact on prices,” Kuwaiti Minister Tariq Al-Roumi said in response to a question from Reuters.

Al-Roumi added that he anticipates a shift in demand towards the Gulf and the wider Middle East as a result of the sanctions. “We are seeing signs now,” he said.

Kuwait is among seven OPEC+ members that have been gradually increasing oil production after years of output cuts aimed at supporting the market under the group’s agreement, which includes the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, and several smaller producers.

The alliance, which accounts for around half of global oil supply, has reversed course this year to reclaim market share, responding in part to pressure from President Trump to boost production and help keep petrol prices in check.

OPEC+ has raised its oil output targets by more than 2.7 million barrels per day this year, equivalent to

[TITLE]National Fuel to Acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio Natural Gas Utility Business:
[TEXT]
WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Fuel Gas Company ("National Fuel" or the "Company") (NYSE: NFG) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (“CERC”), a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) (“CenterPoint”) to acquire CenterPoint’s Ohio natural gas utility business (“CNP Ohio”).

National Fuel is acquiring the equity interests in CNP Ohio for total consideration of $2.62 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to customary closing adjustments, representing an acquisition multiple of approximately 1.6x estimated 2026 rate base of $1.6 billion. Upon closing, National Fuel will also acquire a dedicated team of employees that operate approximately 5,900 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline and serve approximately 335,000 residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers that consume approximately 60 Bcf of natural gas per year. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of calendar 2026, pending completion of a notice filing and review with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Hart-Scott-Rodino review, and other customary closing conditions.

This acquisition will add significant regulated scale for National Fuel, doubling the size of the Company’s gas utility rate base, while expanding its operations into the neighboring state of Ohio, a jurisdiction that is both highly supportive of natural gas and maintains a constructive regulatory framework. This significant increase in regulated cash flows, alongside National Fuel’s unique ability to fund future growth capital with free cash flow from its integrated upstream and gathering operations, will further support the Company’s investment grade balance sheet.

“Our acquisition of CNP Ohio aligns with National Fuel’s strategic objective to increase the scale of our regulated operations through the addition of high-quality assets in a favorable regulatory and political jurisdiction. Gaining a strong presence in a neighboring service territory, with a similar workforce culture, and operations that mirror our existing gas utilities in New York and Pennsylvania is an added benefit for our Company as well as our customers, employees, and shareholders,” said David P. Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel.

“Acquiring a natural gas utility of this quality, with a long runway of capital investment pathways, is a great opportunity to reinvest free cash flow from our integrated upstream and gathering operations, further enhancing the long-term outlook for regulated growth,” Bauer continued. “In addition, our prudent approach to financing this acquisition, combined with our increased scale and larger proportion of regulated cash flows, will further strengthen our investment grade credit profile which, in the long-term, should support further avenues for growth on both the regulated and non-regulated sides of our business.”

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply

Uninterruptable Power Supply, by equipment segment, is expected to be the largest market during the forecast period

The Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) market will lead the Power Quality Equipment Market through the forecast period, fueled by the growing dependency on uninterrupted and high-quality power in most sectors. UPS systems offer an important standby power source during power outages, voltage variations, and power disturbances, which ensures uninterrupted operations in critical industries like data centers, healthcare, manufacturing, and commercial facilities. The swift growth of cloud computing, digitalization, and Industry 4.0 has triggered a boom in data centers, which need to be equipped with strong power backup solutions to avoid data loss, equipment failure, and operational downtime. The growing use of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations also demands stable power supply solutions, further driving UPS demand. As governments and businesses invest in smart grids, renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure, UPS systems have a pivotal role in stabilizing power, regulating voltage, and reducing harmonics. Lithium-ion-based UPS systems are also finding favor due to their higher efficiency, extended life, and low maintenance when compared to the conventional lead-acid battery. In addition, businesses in areas with high power outages and grid instability, including areas of Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America, are increasingly using UPS solutions to protect their operations.

Three phase, by phase type, is expected to be the largest segment during the forecast period.

Three-phase segment is anticipated to lead the Power Quality Equipment Market through the forecast period due to the growing need for efficient power distribution in industrial, commercial, and utility industries. Three-phase power systems have superior benefits over single-phase systems, such as better efficiency of power transmission, lower conductor material needs, and increased load-carrying ability, due to which they are the most sought-after solution for applications that need large-scale and continuous power supply. The fast-paced industrialization, especially in developing economies in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America, is driving the need for three-phase power quality solutions to drive manufacturing facilities, data centers, transportation infrastructure, and big commercial complexes. Moreover, increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy systems like solar and wind power is driving the implementation of three-phase inverters, stabilizers, and power conditioners to deal with power variation and improve the stability of the grid. Governments across the globe are also putting money into grid modernization efforts, including installing sophisticated three-phase power distribution networks to enhance the efficiency and dependability of energy. Additionally, high-power equipment-based industries like oil & gas, mining, and heavy manufacturing need three-phase voltage regulators and UPS units for safeguarding equipment against power surges, harmonics, and voltage sags. The growing trend of automation and digitalization within industrial processes further strengthens the demand for stable and quality power, making the three-phase segment's supremacy in the Power Quality Equipment Market even stronger.

North America is anticipated to be the biggest market for power quality equipment over the forecast period due to the strong industrial base of the region, the increasing use of renewable energy, and rising demand for power supply reliability across key sectors. The United States and Canada, among other regions, are experiencing massive investments in industrial automation and grid modernization that require the implementation of power quality solutions like UPS systems, voltage regulators, power conditioners, and harmonic filters. In addition, the increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and installation of EV charging infrastructure throughout the region are contributing to the demand for sophisticated power quality solutions to regulate voltage variation and provide grid stability. Government policies, including the U.S. Canada's Net-Zero Emissions ambition and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), are also propelling the deployment of renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind into the grid, causing power conditioning and energy storage technology demand to be on the increase for mitigating the intermittency aspect. The dominance of the region in the Power Quality Equipment Market is anticipated to be maintained by the presence of dominant market players, as well as strict power reliability regulations for sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and commercial buildings.

[TITLE]Itron and Gordian Technologies Collaborate to Bring AI-Powered Intelligence to the Grid Edge:
[TEXT]
LIBERTY LAKE, Wash., Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ: ITRI), which is innovating new ways for utilities and cities to manage energy and water, is working with Gordian Technologies (Gordian) to bring artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to the grid edge. Itron is enhancing its Grid Edge Intelligence (GEI) portfolio with Gordian’s AI and ML technology and enabling its developer community to access that technology through Itron’s Distributed Intelligence (DI) Developer Program. This enhancement to Itron’s GEI portfolio further enables utilities to improve grid resilience, disaster management and prevention, operational efficiency and to deliver affordable energy to customers.

Itron’s GEI portfolio features an end-to-end suite of solutions that unlock the power of data within a utility’s service territory. Gordian’s optimized software delivers ML and AI capabilities at the edge-device level and supports running inference on multiple models in parallel to maximize the benefits that can be realized. Together, the Gordian and Itron platforms can detect, analyze and classify millions of data events within milliseconds. For the utility, this unlocks even greater value from their smart infrastructure investments, lowering operational costs and improving their service.

The Gordian platform will be available later this year through Itron’s DI Developer program, allowing app developers to access this high-powered tool to deliver added value solutions for utility customers and to further enhance Itron’s GEI portfolio. Within the DI Developer platform, utilities can leverage the Gordian technology to address a wide range of use cases, such as electric vehicle connection detection and arc flash detection, that help solve operational challenges and better serve their customers. Itron first plans to apply Gordian’s technology to enhance its own anomaly detection and classification solution, using ML algorithms to classify anomalies for field investigation.

“Our vision with Gordian is to apply AI and ML across the grid edge to unlock new levels of intelligence and responsiveness for utilities. This is a powerful capability that will deliver a set of advantages which include: faster response times, lower operational costs, decentralized automation and the ability to make decisions based on real-time, site-specific data,” said Don Reeves, senior vice president of Outcomes at Itron. “Enhancing Itron’s GEI portfolio with Gordian’s AI and ML technology enables a more adaptive approach to modern grid management and we are excited
