Key Factors Driving the KRAS Inhibitors Market

Large, Addressable Patient Population Across Solid Tumours

KRAS is the most frequently mutated of the three RAS genes, followed by NRAS and HRAS. KRAS mutations are commonly associated with several types of cancer, including pancreatic, colorectal, lung adenocarcinomas, ovarian, and others. The United States had the highest number of KRAS mutation cases in NSCLC among the 7MM. ~46% of all KRAS mutation cases in NSCLC in the 7MM were reported in the United States.

Promise of Combination Approaches in KRAS Therapies

Combining KRAS-targeted therapies with other treatment modalities, such as immunotherapies or traditional chemotherapy, holds promise for improving treatment outcomes. The potential for combination therapies creates additional market opportunities and enhances the overall market strength of KRAS mutations.

Expanding Opportunities in the Pan-KRAS Space

Many KRAS inhibitor companies are focusing on developing their candidates in pan-KRAS, like Cardiff Oncology (onvansertib), Immuneering Corporation (IMM-1-104), Jacobio Pharma (JAB-23E73), Eli Lilly and Company (LY4066434), and others are expected to have tremendous market potential due to the broad target patient population they can address.

Advancing Treatment Across Mutation Subtypes and Tumor Types

Several KRAS inhibitor companies, including Roche, Revolution Medicines, Eli Lilly, and others, are advancing promising candidates such as divarasib, daraxonrasib, and olomorasib, with the aim of expanding the therapeutic scope of KRAS-targeted treatments across various mutation subtypes and tumor types.

KRAS Inhibitors Market Analysis

KRAS is a well-known oncogene frequently mutated across multiple cancer types, including NSCLC, PDAC, CRC, and ovarian cancer. Once deemed “undruggable,” KRAS has re-emerged as a major therapeutic target with the advent of mutation-specific inhibitors, particularly those directed against the KRAS G12C mutation. Drugs such as LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) and KRAZATI (adagrasib) selectively bind to KRAS in its inactive GDP-bound form, demonstrating clinical benefit in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated tumors who have received prior treatments.

Amgen’s LUMAKRAS became the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to gain FDA approval in 2021 for NSCLC, followed by global authorizations and a subsequent CRC indication in combination with VECTIBIX, based on improved progression-free survival. Patient selection is supported by companion diagnostics like Qiagen’s therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit.

Bristol Myers Squibb’s KRAZATI, launched in 2022, has since outpaced LUMAKRAS in clinical uptake, earning accelerated approvals for both NSCLC and mCRC. LUMAKRAS sales later declined, which Amgen attributed to a price adjustment under a reimbursement agreement in Germany. KRAZATI has also been incorporated into the NCCN Guidelines for CNS-metastatic NSCLC, underscoring its expanding clinical role. Nevertheless, both primary and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors remain significant challenges.

Beyond G12C, the pursuit of therapies targeting other KRAS mutations is fueling next-generation development. Verastem’s AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA Co-Pack recently became the first FDA-approved treatment for KRAS-mutated recurrent LGSOC, addressing an unmet clinical need. Combination regimens, pairing KRAS inhibitors with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or pan-KRAS agents, are also being actively explored.

Leading biopharmaceutical companies are expanding their efforts to target alternative KRAS variants and additional cancer indications, aiming to enhance the therapeutic potential of KRAS inhibition. Firms such as Cardiff Oncology (onvansertib), Immuneering (IMM-1-104), and Verastem (Avutometinib + Defactinib) are developing pan-KRAS strategies. Meanwhile, Roche, Revolution Medicines, and Eli Lilly are advancing next-generation compounds, such as divarasib, daraxonrasib, and olomorasib, to target multiple mutation subtypes and tumor types.

Despite encouraging progress, KRAS-driven cancers continue to present hurdles due to tumor heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms. Continued innovation in targeted therapies, biomarker-guided treatment, and combination strategies will be crucial to harness the therapeutic potential of KRAS inhibition in oncology fully.

Once deemed “undruggable,” KRAS has re-emerged as a major therapeutic target with the advent of mutation-specific inhibitors, particularly those directed against the KRAS G12C mutation. Drugs such as LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) and KRAZATI (adagrasib) selectively bind to KRAS in its inactive GDP-bound form, demonstrating clinical benefit in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated tumors who have received prior treatments.

Amgen’s LUMAKRAS became the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to gain FDA approval in 2021 for NSCLC, followed by global authorizations and a subsequent CRC indication in combination with VECTIBIX, based on improved progression-free survival. Patient selection is supported by companion diagnostics like Qiagen’s therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit.

Bristol Myers Squibb’s KRAZATI, launched in 2022, has since outpaced LUMAKRAS in clinical uptake, earning accelerated approvals for both NSCLC and mCRC. LUMAKRAS sales later declined, which Amgen attributed to a price adjustment under a reimbursement agreement in Germany. KRAZATI has also been incorporated into the NCCN Guidelines for CNS-metastatic NSCLC, underscoring its expanding clinical role. Nevertheless, both primary and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors remain significant challenges.

Beyond G12C, the pursuit of therapies targeting other KRAS mutations is fueling next-generation development. Verastem’s AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA Co-Pack recently became the first FDA-approved treatment for KRAS-mutated recurrent LGSOC, addressing an unmet clinical need. Combination regimens, pairing KRAS inhibitors with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or pan-KRAS agents, are also being actively explored.

Leading biopharmaceutical companies are expanding their efforts to target alternative KRAS variants and additional cancer indications, aiming to enhance the therapeutic potential of KRAS inhibition. Firms such as Cardiff Oncology (onvansertib), Immuneering (IMM-1-104), and Verastem (Avutometinib + Defactinib) are developing pan-KRAS strategies. Meanwhile, Roche, Revolution Medicines, and Eli Lilly are advancing next-generation compounds, such as divarasib, daraxonrasib, and olomorasib, to target multiple mutation subtypes and tumor types.

Despite encouraging progress, KRAS-driven cancers continue to present hurdles due to tumor heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms. Continued innovation in targeted therapies, biomarker-guided treatment, and combination strategies will be crucial to harness the therapeutic potential of KRAS inhibition in oncology fully.

[TITLE]ProKidney Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Regulatory and Clinical Updates:
[TEXT]
Full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study of rilparencel were recently presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025

More than half of the patients required for the Phase 3 REGEN-006 (PROACT 1) accelerated approval analysis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope have been enrolled; topline results anticipated in Q2 2027

Ended the third quarter with $272 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, supporting operations into mid-2027

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProKidney Corp. (Nasdaq: PROK) (“ProKidney” or the “Company"), a leading late clinical-stage cell therapy company focused on chronic kidney disease (CKD), today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, and provided regulatory and clinical updates.

“The Phase 2 REGEN-007 full results recently presented at ASN Kidney Week further strengthen the body of evidence supporting our ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study and underscore the potential of rilparencel to become a novel treatment option for patients with advanced CKD and diabetes,” said Bruce Culleton, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of ProKidney. “In Group 1, which mirrored the dosing regimen being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study, treatment with rilparencel led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful stabilization of kidney function. Notably, 63% of Group 1 patients met the key PROACT 1 inclusion criteria, and similar efficacy was observed in this subgroup compared to the overall Group 1 results. We remain focused on the continued execution of PROACT 1 to bring a potential new treatment option to patients with advanced CKD and diabetes at high risk of kidney failure, an area of significant unmet need.”

Phase 2 REGEN-007 Full Results Recently Presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025

On November 6, 2025, ProKidney presented full results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study evaluating rilparencel in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes. The data, featured in a late-breaking clinical trials presentation, further demonstrate the potential of rilparencel to preserve kidney function in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes who are at high risk of kidney failure. Highlights include:

In Group 1 (n=24), bilateral kidney injection with rilparencel resulted in a 4.6 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 78% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p<0.001) Among Group 1 patients, 15 of 24 (63%) met key Phase 3 PROACT 1 inclusion criteria; in this subgroup, bilateral kidney injection resulted in a 5.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005)

improvement in the annual decline in eGFR slope; this 85% improvement was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (p=0.005) Post-hoc analysis of patient subgroups on standard-of-care (SOC) medications, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), suggest rilparencel had a treatment effect incremental to that observed with SOC

Rilparencel was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile

Phase 3 PROACT 1 Registrational Program Update: Alignment Achieved with FDA on Accelerated Path

In a July 2025 Type B meeting, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that eGFR slope in patients from the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study can serve as the surrogate endpoint and primary basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission of rilparencel under the accelerated approval pathway. The FDA also confirmed that PROACT 1 may be used to support both accelerated and confirmatory approval of rilparencel. ProKidney continues to maintain its ongoing dialogue with the FDA under rilparencel’s regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation. More than half of the approximately 360 patients required for the accelerated approval analysis using eGFR slope had been enrolled as of August 2025. Topline data readout to support an application for accelerated approval is anticipated in Q2 2027. Rilparencel is the only cell therapy in a Phase 3 clinical study for the treatment of CKD and type 2 diabetes.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights

Liquidity: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2025, totaled $271.7 million, compared to $358.3 million on December 31, 2024. ProKidney expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held on September 30, 2025, will enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2027.

R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $4.4 million was driven primarily by decreases in costs for clinical operations of approximately $4.2 million driven by the wind down of activities related to REGEN-016 and our other clinical trials that have been completed or terminated. Additionally, the Company has seen decreases in spending on manufacturing process development and professional fees of approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. These decreases have been partially offset by increases in equity and cash compensation costs of approximately $1.4 million as the Company continues to hire additional personnel to support our operations and increases in materials costs of $1.2 million to support the Phase 3 clinical program.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $17.7 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of $5.8 million has been primarily driven by the decrease in the amount of non-cash impairment charges of $5.0 million related to the Greensboro facility and decreases in cash and equity compensation of approximately $1.9 million. These increases have been partially offset by increases in professional fees of approximately $0.8 million.

Net Loss Before Noncontrolling Interest: Net loss before noncontrolling interest was $35.8 million and $41.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Shares outstanding: Class A and Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2025 totaled 295,266,876.

Individuals who have a protective loss-of-function variant in one copy of the INHBE gene have a healthier cardiometabolic profile, including less abdominal fat, lower triglycerides, and lower risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. At ObesityWeek®, Wave presented preclinical data supporting WVE-007’s potential as a monotherapy treatment, as an add-on to semaglutide, and as a maintenance therapy to prevent rebound weight gain following cessation of GLP-1. In preclinical models, INHBE GalNAc-siRNA led to adipocyte shrinkage, fewer pro-inflammatory macrophages, less fibrosis, and improved insulin sensitivity in adipose tissues, supporting potential for metabolic improvement.

INLIGHT is an ongoing, first-in-human clinical trial (3:1 active: placebo) evaluating WVE-007 in adults living with overweight or obesity and assesses safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, Activin E, body weight and composition, and biomarkers of metabolic health.

is an ongoing, first-in-human clinical trial (3:1 active: placebo) evaluating WVE-007 in adults living with overweight or obesity and assesses safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, Activin E, body weight and composition, and biomarkers of metabolic health. In October 2025, Wave shared Activin E target engagement data from INLIGHT. Highly significant (p<0.0001 for all doses), dose-dependent mean Activin E reductions from baseline were observed at Day 29 (one month post single dose) in the first three cohorts: 85% reduction (Cohort 3), 75% reduction (Cohort 2), 56% reduction (Cohort 1), exceeding levels that led to weight loss and prevention of rebound weight gain following cessation of GLP-1 in preclinical models. Activin E reduction in Cohort 1, the lowest single dose cohort of INLIGHT, was sustained through six months, supporting once or twice a year dosing. WVE-007 was generally safe and well-tolerated.

INLIGHT is currently ongoing at multiple trial sites, including in the US following clearance of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Wave has expanded Cohort 2, Cohort 3, and Cohort 4 (600 mg) to 32 individuals and the independent data monitoring committee approved escalation to a higher dose in Cohort 5.

Expected milestones: Wave expects to deliver multiple clinical data updates from INLIGHT, including body composition and body weight. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Wave expects to deliver three-month follow-up data from Cohort 2 (240 mg), as well as data from Cohort 1 (75 mg). In the first quarter of 2026, Wave expects to deliver six-month follow-up data from Cohort 2 and three-month follow-up data from Cohort 3 (400 mg). In the second quarter of 2026, Wave expects to deliver six-month follow-up data from Cohort 3 and three-month follow-up data from Cohort 4 (600 mg).

RestorAATion-1 (healthy volunteer study) completed in 2024 and RestorAATion-2 (Phase 1b/2a open-label study with both single and multiple ascending dose portions) is ongoing and evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of WVE-006 in individuals with AATD who have the homozygous Pi*ZZ mutation. In September 2025, Wave announced clinical data from the 200 mg single and multidose cohorts and 400 mg single dose cohort of RestorAATion-2 that demonstrate WVE-006 achieved key AATD treatment goals to recapitulate the MZ phenotype. AAT protein exceeded 20 µM during an acute phase response, basal AAT levels reached 13 µM, wild-type M-AAT protein reached 64% of serum AAT, and mutant, Z-AAT was reduced by 60%.

WVE-006 was generally safe and well tolerated, all adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity, and there were no SAEs.

Dosing is ongoing in the 400 mg multidose cohort with a monthly dosing regimen. Dosing is ongoing in the 600 mg single dose cohort.

Expected milestones: Wave expects to deliver data from the 400 mg multidose cohort in the first quarter of 2026. Wave also expects to deliver single and multidose data from the third and final cohort (600 mg) in 2026.

Emerging wholly owned siRNA and RNA editing pipeline

Wave is advancing new targets across multiple disease areas to expand its pipeline of wholly owned programs in both rare and common diseases. Wave’s pipeline of preclinical candidates utilizes the company’s proprietary chemistry to achieve potential best-in-class RNA editing and RNAi in a variety of hepatic and extra-hepatic tissues. Within RNA editing, Wave has demonstrated the ability to correct single variants to restore wild-type protein function and to increase the stability of the mRNA transcript to upregulate protein levels. Within RNAi, Wave has shared preclinical data which support that its SpiNA designs enable RNAi-mediated silencing by further improving Ago2 loading and pharmacokinetics, leading to increased potency and durability compared to industry benchmarks.

WVE-008: In October of 2025, Wave announced that it advanced WVE-008, an investigational GalNAc-conjugated RNA editing oligonucleotide (AIMer), as its clinical candidate for PNPLA3 I148M liver disease. There are an estimated nine million homozygous PNPLA3 I148M individuals with liver disease in the U.S. and Europe. These homozygous carriers have a significantly higher risk of liver-related death compared to heterozygous carriers. The PNPLA3 I148M variant is a well-established driver of steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis; however, there are no approved medicines that directly address this biology. Emerging preclinical and clinical data indicate that knocking down PNPLA3 is not an optimal approach as loss of PNPLA3 function inadequately addresses steatosis and fibrosis. To effectively address these manifestations of the disease, Wave uses its novel RNA editing approach. In preclinical studies, Wave has demonstrated that RNA editing with its PNPLA3 GalNAc-AIMer restores functional PNPLA3 protein and decreases lipid accumulation. Wave expects to file a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) for WVE-008 in 2026.

Bifunctional single oligonucleotide construct (RNAi+RNA editing): In October of 2025, Wave shared that it has applied its chemistry optimization with learnings from across its platform to investigate a new modality. This bifunctional single oligonucleotide construct is designed to silence one target while simultaneously editing or upregulating another distinct target. Wave confirmed the ability of its bifunctional single oligonucleotide construct to engage in silencing and editing in vivo using a GalNAc-conjugated oligonucleotide that is designed to simultaneously edit UGP2 and silence TTR. In a separate preclinical study, Wave also demonstrated simultaneous upregulation of LDLR and silencing of PCSK9.

Wave shared additional information on its emerging pipeline at its annual Research Day.

DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy)

WVE-N531 is an investigational exon skipping oligonucleotide being developed as a disease modifying treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 53 skipping. WVE-N531 was designed using Wave’s best-in-class oligonucleotide chemistry modifications, including PN backbone chemistry. WVE-N531 has received Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.

Key Factors Driving the KRAS Inhibitors Market

Large, Addressable Patient Population Across Solid Tumours

KRAS is the most frequently mutated of the three RAS genes, followed by NRAS and HRAS. KRAS mutations are commonly associated with several types of cancer, including pancreatic, colorectal, lung adenocarcinomas, ovarian, and others. The United States had the highest number of KRAS mutation cases in NSCLC among the 7MM. ~46% of all KRAS mutation cases in NSCLC in the 7MM were reported in the United States.

Promise of Combination Approaches in KRAS Therapies

Combining KRAS-targeted therapies with other treatment modalities, such as immunotherapies or traditional chemotherapy, holds promise for improving treatment outcomes. The potential for combination therapies creates additional market opportunities and enhances the overall market strength of KRAS mutations.

Expanding Opportunities in the Pan-KRAS Space

Many KRAS inhibitor companies are focusing on developing their candidates in pan-KRAS, like Cardiff Oncology (onvansertib), Immuneering Corporation (IMM-1-104), Jacobio Pharma (JAB-23E73), Eli Lilly and Company (LY4066434), and others are expected to have tremendous market potential due to the broad target patient population they can address.

Advancing Treatment Across Mutation Subtypes and Tumor Types

Several KRAS inhibitor companies, including Roche, Revolution Medicines, Eli Lilly, and others, are advancing promising candidates such as divarasib, daraxonrasib, and olomorasib, with the aim of expanding the therapeutic scope of KRAS-targeted treatments across various mutation subtypes and tumor types.

KRAS Inhibitors Market Analysis

KRAS is a well-known oncogene frequently mutated across multiple cancer types, including NSCLC, PDAC, CRC, and ovarian cancer. Once deemed “undruggable,” KRAS has re-emerged as a major therapeutic target with the advent of mutation-specific inhibitors, particularly those directed against the KRAS G12C mutation. Drugs such as LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) and KRAZATI (adagrasib) selectively bind to KRAS in its inactive GDP-bound form, demonstrating clinical benefit in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated tumors who have received prior treatments.

Amgen’s LUMAKRAS became the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to gain FDA approval in 2021 for NSCLC, followed by global authorizations and a subsequent CRC indication in combination with VECTIBIX, based on improved progression-free survival. Patient selection is supported by companion diagnostics like Qiagen’s therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit.

Bristol Myers Squibb’s KRAZATI, launched in 2022, has since outpaced LUMAKRAS in clinical uptake, earning accelerated approvals for both NSCLC and mCRC. LUMAKRAS sales later declined, which Amgen attributed to a price adjustment under a reimbursement agreement in Germany. KRAZATI has also been incorporated into the NCCN Guidelines for CNS-metastatic NSCLC, underscoring its expanding clinical role. Nevertheless, both primary and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors remain significant challenges.

Beyond G12C, the pursuit of therapies targeting other KRAS mutations is fueling next-generation development. Verastem’s AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA Co-Pack recently became the first FDA-approved treatment for KRAS-mutated recurrent LGSOC, addressing an unmet clinical need. Combination regimens, pairing KRAS inhibitors with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or pan-KRAS agents, are also being actively explored.

Leading biopharmaceutical companies are expanding their efforts to target alternative KRAS variants and additional cancer indications, aiming to enhance the therapeutic potential of KRAS inhibition. Firms such as Cardiff Oncology (onvansertib), Immuneering (IMM-1-104), and Verastem (Avutometinib + Defactinib) are developing pan-KRAS strategies. Meanwhile, Roche, Revolution Medicines, and Eli Lilly are advancing next-generation compounds, such as divarasib, daraxonrasib, and olomorasib, to target multiple mutation subtypes and tumor types.

Despite encouraging progress, KRAS-driven cancers continue to present hurdles due to tumor heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms. Continued innovation in targeted therapies, biomarker-guided treatment, and combination strategies will be crucial to harness the therapeutic potential of KRAS inhibition in oncology fully.

[TITLE]X9, Inc. Announces Successful Completion of First-in-Human Feasibility Study for Ultrasound-Guided, Power-Assisted Needle Insertion Device in Hemodialysis Cannulation:
[TEXT]
WALLINGFORD, Conn., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- X9, Inc. today announced positive results from its first-in-human clinical feasibility study evaluating the X9 Ultrasound System with Power-Assisted Needle Insertion, the company’s innovative handheld device for ultrasound-guided, power-assisted needle insertion in arteriovenous fistula (AVF) cannulation for hemodialysis patients.

The clinical study was conducted at the Territorial Medical Association of Yangiyul district, Republic of Uzbekistan, and received Ethics Committee approval. The study enrolled adult hemodialysis patients with upper extremity AVF and assessed the device’s ability to safely perform needle insertion based on machine learning-enabled, real-time ultrasound data analysis.

“The X9 Ultrasound System is designed to address barriers in vascular access, simplifying workflows and reducing reliance on specialized operator training,” said Eb Bright, CEO of X9, Inc. “This successful first-in-human trial is a significant milestone validating our platform’s potential to transform vascular access.”

Key study highlights:

The device consistently enabled precise vessel alignment and accurate needle placement using real-time, machine learning-assisted vessel alignment.

All procedures were performed by a local nephrologist following brief training on the device, supporting the device’s ease-of-use and rapid adoption potential.

The system utilized standard disposable dialysis needles, integrating seamlessly with existing dialysis clinic workflows and cost thresholds.

Traditional cannulation techniques in hemodialysis often depend on operator experience, and miscannulation leads to notable patient and healthcare burdens. Building upon X9’s 510k-cleared Ultrasound-only system, this innovative X9 Ultrasound-Guided, Power-Assisted System offers a single-handed, operator-controlled solution, overcoming the need for ultrasound image interpretation and two-handed needle insertion.

Results from this pilot feasibility study lay the groundwork for expanded clinical trials.

“These initial data support the potential of ultrasound-guided, power-assisted cannulation devices to streamline vascular access procedures and improve outcome consistency,” stated Sherzod Iskhakov, MD, PhD, Nano Medical Clinic.
