[TITLE]Exxon Seals Massive Trinidad Oil and Gas Exploration Deal:
[TEXT]
Exxon has sealed a deal with the Trinidad and Tobago government for deepwater exploration that could involve investments of $21.7 billion, according to the Caribbean nation’s energy minister.

“What we are awarding today is larger than the surface area of the country,” Roodal Moonilat said as he broke the news of the new deal, saying the area that Exxon will explore was the size of seven normal offshore blocks.

Said area lies northwest of the Stabroek block—the offshore Guyana block that Exxon has been developing since 2005, with the first production well drilled in 2015. Since the start of exploration, Exxon has tapped an estimated 11 billion barrels in reserves and production has grown rapidly, turning Guyana into a rare hot spot in the world of oil. Plans are to pump 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2030. To date, production runs at 900,000 barrels daily.

Due to its proximity to the Guyana oil bounty, Trinidad and Tobago made a logical choice for Exxon. The supermajor had a presence in the Caribbean country until 2003, when it announced it would quit, following an unsuccessful exploration campaign.

Despite that failure, Trinidad and Tobago is the largest oil and gas producer in the Caribbean and the 17th largest in the world. Its oil and gas industry is seen growing at a compound annual rate of 4.4% over the decade to 2030, with companies involved in that growth including BP, Shell, and Spain’s Repsol—and now Exxon, which very much hopes to replicate its Guyana story in Trinidad.

The new exploration campaign will begin with an investment of $42 million and the drilling of two wells, the first of which could be drilled in six months, once the company finishes with its seismic survey of the area. If that is successful, development could be even faster than it was in Guyana, Reuters noted in a report on the news.

[TITLE]Oil steadies on reports of US-Russia deal but ends week about 5% lower:
[TEXT]
SINGAPORE (Reuters): Oil held steady on Friday as markets awaited a meeting in the coming days between Russian president Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, but prices marked their steepest weekly losses since late June on a tariff-hit economic outlook.

Brent crude futures settled 16 cents, or 0.2%, higher at US$66.59 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were unchanged at US$63.88.

Brent fell 4.4% over the week, while WTI finished 5.1% lower than last Friday's close.

US crude fell over 1% earlier in the session after Bloomberg News reported that Washington and Moscow were aiming to reach a deal to halt the war in Ukraine that would lock in Russia's occupation of territory seized during its military invasion.

US and Russian officials are working towards an agreement on territories for a planned summit meeting between Trump and Putin as early as next week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The potential meeting raises expectations of a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine, which could lead to eased sanctions on Russia, and comes as trade tensions have been on the rise between Trump and buyers of Russian oil.

This week, Trump threatened to increase tariffs on India if it kept purchasing Russian oil. Trump also said China, the largest buyer of Russian crude, could be hit with tariffs similar to those levied against Indian imports.

"Various non-oil considerations are at play, including fears over the impact of tariffs and the headlines flying over the last few days regarding a Trump and Putin meeting in the near term," said Neil Crosby, an energy market analyst at Sparta Commodities.

"Headline risk is particularly strong currently with flip-flopping regarding who will turn up to a meeting over Ukraine and under what circumstances."

Higher U.S. tariffs on imports from a host of trade partners went into effect on Thursday, raising concern over economic activity and demand for crude oil, ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.

OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, adding to supply.

The U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 411 this week.

"Bearish sentiment has returned this week as key OPEC+ members announced a second 'quadruple' output unwind for September (thus fully restoring their extra voluntary cuts of 2.2 mmb/d) and President Trump's sweeping import tariffs took effect against most countries," analysts at FGE NexantECA said.

Trump on Thursday also said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve, fuelling expectations of a more dovish policy ahead.

Lower interest rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and can boost economic growth and demand for oil.

The dollar firmed on Friday but headed for a weekly fall. A stronger dollar hurts demand for dollar-denominated crude from foreign buyers.

Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to August 5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.
