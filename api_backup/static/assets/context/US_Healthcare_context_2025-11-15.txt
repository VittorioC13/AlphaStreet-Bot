SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxart, Inc. (OTCQX: VXRT) (“Vaxart or “the Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a range of oral recombinant pill vaccines based on its proprietary delivery platform, today announced its business update and financial results for the third quarter of 2025.

“Our commitment at Vaxart is to advance the science of our novel, oral vaccine platform,” said Steven Lo, Chief Executive Officer of Vaxart. “The collaboration agreement with Dynavax is an important step forward in realizing this goal as it both brings in a proven partner to the future development and commercialization of our oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate and enhances our financial position. Following the completed enrollment of approximately 5,400 participants in our COVID-19 Phase 2b trial, we are on track to report multiple datasets in 2026 that we believe will provide useful insights and a strong foundation of evidence that could further validate our platform.”

“Additionally, we showcased positive topline results from our Phase 1 trial demonstrating that our second-generation oral pill norovirus vaccine constructs produced much stronger antibody responses than our first-generation constructs at various medical meetings globally. We continue to explore value-creating partnership opportunities for our norovirus candidate as well as our HPV and flu programs, which have demonstrated promising data in preclinical and clinical studies.”

Recent Business Highlights

COVID-19 Vaccine Developments

In November 2025, entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Dynavax Technologies Corporation, for the rights to the Company’s COVID-19 oral vaccine candidate. Received an upfront license fee of $25 million plus a $5 million equity investment at a per share price premium to market pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement. Dynavax will receive an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize oral COVID-19 vaccines based on Vaxart’s delivery platform. Vaxart will retain full operational and financial responsibility for the oral COVID-19 vaccine program through the completion of the ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial and the subsequent End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); In addition, after receiving the results of the Phase 2b clinical trial, Dynavax will pay an additional fee of $50 million to Vaxart, unless Dynavax elects not to assume responsibility for continued clinical development of the oral COVID-19 vaccine program (in which case, the license agreement will terminate); and In addition, if Dynavax elects to assume responsibility for the continued development of the oral COVID-19 program, Vaxart may be entitled to receive up to $195 million in potential future regulatory milestone payments, up to $425 million in potential future net sales milestone payments, and tiered royalties at rates in the low-to-mid teens on potential future net sales of oral COVID-19 vaccines.

Vaxart completed enrollment of approximately 5,400 participants for the COVID-19 Phase 2b trial. Vaxart continues all work as planned with the per protocol follow-up of all participants dosed. Participants are being monitored for up to 12 months post-vaccination to assess safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Topline data is anticipated in late 2026. Data from the 400-person sentinel cohort is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. As of September 30, 2025, the Company has received $125.9 million of cash payments associated with this award.

Norovirus Vaccine Developments

In September 2025, Vaxart announced additional Phase 1 data supporting the potential efficacy of its second-generation norovirus oral pill vaccine candidate. Research demonstrated that second-generation constructs induce robust increases in fecal IgA, which was shown to be correlated with protection against infection in the company’s previous Phase 2b challenge study. Vaxart intends to publish the complete results of this study in a peer-reviewed journal. Data was presented at the 9th International Calicivirus Conference, World Vaccine Congress and IDWeek 2025. Pending a partnership or other funding, Vaxart expects to initiate the next clinical trial in 2026.

Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2025

Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $28.8 million as of September 30, 2025. With the receipt of the upfront payment from Dynavax, Vaxart currently anticipates cash runway into the second quarter of 2027. The Company remains aggressive in exploring various strategies to extend its cash runway through business development partnerships and non-dilutive funding options, with the goal of achieving its upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones and maximizing stockholder value.

Revenue for the third quarter of 2025 was $72.4 million, compared to $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. Revenue in the third quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2024 were primarily from government contracts related to the BARDA contract awarded in June 2024.

Research and development expenses were $75.9 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $15.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase is primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses related to Vaxart’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, partially offset by a decrease in preclinical, manufacturing expenses and personnel costs.

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Vaxart reported a net loss of $8.1 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. Net loss per share for the third quarter of 2025 was $0.04, compared to a net loss of $0.06 per share for the third quarter of 2024.

BioPorto Executes on its Financing Strategy - BioPorto A/S initiates pre-subscribed private placement

Copenhagen, Denmark, 13 November 2025, (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – BioPorto A/S (“BioPorto” or the “Company”) (CPH:BIOPOR) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the launch of a pre-subscribed private placement of up to 40,438,426 new shares at market price (the “Offering”).

On November 4, 2025, BioPorto announced its Financing Strategy, outlining the Company’s commitment to achieving positive cashflow in the second half of 2027. The strategy identified a funding need of DKK 60–70 million to support the completion of the U.S. clinical study for adults and to further strengthen BioPorto’s commercial platform. A range of financing alternatives – including equity issuance and other strategic financing solutions – were evaluated to ensure robust support for the Company’s long-term growth and operational objectives.

The Board of Directors has now executed the first step of this strategy by initiating this private placement of up to 40,438,426 new shares at market price. The Offering is fully pre-subscribed, with advance indications received for the entire amount, and is expected to raise gross proceeds of approximately DKK 43 million.

Jens Due Olsen, Chair of the Board of BioPorto, commented: “We greatly appreciate the strong support from both existing shareholders and new institutional and private investors, supplemented by a strong commitment from BioPorto’s Board and management. The private placement provides the financial flexibility to advance our strategic priorities, including completing data collection, submitting a pre-submission to the FDA, and initiating the Validation Study in BioPorto’s U.S. clinical trial, while strengthening our commercial platform. In determining the size of this placement, the Board considered the Company’s range of future financing options, primarily in the form of potential divestments of non-core assets supplemented with credit facilities. The decision taken ensures a balanced and prudent funding structure while covering the projected spending throughout 2026 and thereby positions the Company strongly for its journey towards positive cash flow in the second half of 2027.”

Key Terms of the Offering

The Offering is made as a cash share capital increase directed at a limited group of shareholders, institutional and financial investors without pre-emptive subscription rights for the Company’s existing shareholders in accordance with the authorization stipulated in Article 17e and 17f of BioPorto’s Articles of Association.

The Offering comprises up to 40,438,426 new shares of nominally DKK 1 each, equivalent to 8.89% of BioPorto’s registered share capital prior to the share capital increase.

The subscription price is DKK 1.072, which corresponds to the closing price of BioPorto shares traded on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 13 November 2025. The expected total gross proceeds from the share issue will amount to approximately DKK 43 million at full subscription.

The new shares will carry the same rights as existing shares in BioPorto. The new shares will be negotiable instruments, and no restrictions will apply to their transferability. No shares, including the new shares, carry or will carry any special rights. The new shares shall be registered in the name of the holder through VP Securities A/S (Euronext Securities Copenhagen). The rights relating to the new shares, including voting rights and dividend rights, will apply from the time when the capital increase is registered with the Danish Business Authority. In the event of oversubscription, the Board of Directors will determine the allocation of the new shares.

The Offering will be carried out as a directed issue to eligible institutional and professional investors in Denmark pursuant to applicable exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus under the Prospectus Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. The Offering will be made without pre-emption rights for BioPorto's existing shareholders.

Expected timeline

The subscription period will commence immediately and close at short notice. The results of the Offering will be announced as soon as practicably possible thereafter.

The share capital increase will be registered with the Danish Business Authority as soon as the subscription amount is fully paid, currently expected to be on 24 November 2025.

The new shares are expected to be admitted to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S under the Company’s permanent ISIN-code (DK0011048619) as soon as possible thereafter, currently expected to be no later than 26 November 2025. The admission to trading and official listing of the new shares is subject to the Offering not being withdrawn prior to the settlement of the Offering and the Company making an announcement to that effect.

[TITLE]SeaStar Medical Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial:
[TEXT]
Business highlights include:

Three new top-rated children’s hospitals adopt QUELIMMUNE therapy for ultra-rare pediatric Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

Commercial use of QUELIMMUNE therapy demonstrates positive survival results as reported from the QUELIMMUNE SAVE Surveillance Registry

New clinical sites added to expand adult NEUTRALIZE-AKI pivotal trial enrollment

Strengthened the balance sheet, raising $12.4 million to fund future operations

Webcast call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time

DENVER, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SeaStar Medical Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: ICU), a commercial-stage healthcare company focused on transforming treatments for critically ill patients facing organ failure and potential loss of life, announced today financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and provided business updates on key initiatives.

“In the third quarter, we made strong progress on multiple fronts which we believe position us well for our future growth,” said Eric Schlorff, CEO of SeaStar Medical. “We added three top-ranked children’s medical centers to our growing customer base and also reported very impressive survival results for the use of the QUELIMMUNE therapy in the treatment of 21 pediatric patients in a commercial setting. And we are gaining traction in the market. In the first half of the fourth quarter, we are extremely pleased to see very strong QUELIMMUNE sales, with orders to date already exceeding orders for the entire third quarter.”

Mr. Schlorff continued, “In addition, we completed the interim analysis, enabling us to understand early safety data and trends toward efficacy for our NEUTRALIZE-AKI pivotal clinical trial of the selective cytopheretic device (SCD) therapy in adult patients with AKI. We also continued to add new clinical sites to ensure we meet our enrollment target by the end of 2026. In addition, we continued our disciplined effort to reduce costs while achieving strong operational results and we raised over $12 million to strengthen our balance sheet and extend our financial runway.”

Key Business Highlights

Since the beginning of the third quarter, SeaStar Medical’s key business updates include the following:

Broadened the QUELIMMUNE customer base, securing three new customers from top-rated children’s hospitals and building increased depth in the number of customers ordering QUELIMMUNE, with fourth quarter orders to date already exceeding third quarter orders.

Presented at the 5th International Symposium on Acute Kidney Injury in Children real-world pediatric patient survival data from the commercial use of the QUELIMMUNE therapy based on early results from the SAVE Surveillance Registry of 21 critically ill pediatric patients with life-threatening AKI and sepsis or a septic condition in the commercial setting. The preliminary results showed no device related safety events with the QUELIMMUNE therapy with 76% of patients surviving through 60 days and 71% surviving through 90 days. These new data are on track to validate a 50% reduction in loss of life compared to historical data, as reported previously in Kidney Medicine.

Announced a positive signal toward efficacy and zero device-related safety issues from the interim analysis of the NEUTRALIZE-AKI pivotal clinical trial by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Review Board (DSMB). Based on the analysis by the DSMB, the total enrollment for the trial has been adjusted from 200 to approximately 339 patients. The Company anticipates completing enrollment near the end of 2026, based on the current enrollment rate of clinical trial sites and the addition of several new sites in the NEUTRALIZE-AKI trial.

Enrolled 21 additional patients in the NEUTRALIZE-AKI pivotal clinical trial, bringing total enrollment to 146 of an anticipated 339 total patients.

Initiated its first clinical site for the NEUTRALIZE-CRS clinical trial of the SCD therapy to treat patients with acute chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) awaiting left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. The trial is expected to enroll 20 patients in the ICU setting with CHF and CRS who are ineligible for LVAD or heart transplantation. If successful, this study could pave the way for a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Raised $12.4 million through equity offerings priced at the market and through the exercise of 2.8 million warrants in the third quarter. The additional infusion of capital strengthens the balance sheet and enables the company to focus its cash resources on the development of its SCD therapy for adult patients with AKI requiring CRRT, an annual U.S. market opportunity that is 50 times larger than the U.S. pediatric AKI market.

Financial Results for the Third Quarter 2025

Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, was approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, reflecting sales of the QUELIMMUNE pediatric SCD therapy that was approved under a Humanitarian Device Exemption in February 2024 and launched as a commercial product by SeaStar Medical in July 2024.

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, was $14 thousand and $0 respectively. QUELIMMUNE units sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024, were expensed to research and development, consistent with U.S. GAAP, as they were acquired prior to commercialization of QUELIMMUNE.

Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, were $1.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily driven by a decline in consulting expenses and personnel costs, partially offset by increased clinical research and development costs.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, were approximately $1.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of lower franchise tax expense, and a decline in legal and consulting related fees, partially offset by higher audit fees.

Other income (net) for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was approximately $0.1 million compared to other expense of approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily related to an increase in interest income and decline in interest expense.

Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was approximately $3.5 million, or $0.13 per share on approximately 26.4 million weighted-average shares outstanding. This compares with a net loss of approximately $4.5 million, or $1.10 per share, on approximately 4.1 million weighted-average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Cash at September 30, 2025, was $13.8 million, compared to $1.8 million at December 31, 2024.

[TITLE]“LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) IV Maintenance Dosing for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease Approved in the United Kingdom:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that humanized anti- soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody “LEQEMBI®” (generic name: lecanemab) has been approved for once every four weeks intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom.

In August 2024, LEQEMBI was approved for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in adult patients that are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4)* heterozygotes or non-carriers in the United Kingdom. With this latest approval for IV maintenance dosing, after 18 months of a dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks patients may be transitioned to the maintenance dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg once every four weeks, or the regimen of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks may be continued.

AD is a progressive, relentless disease characterized by formation of protein deposits known as plaques made of amyloid-beta aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles made of tau protein in the brains of people living with AD. It is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process that begins before amyloid plaque accumulation and continues after plaque removal.1,2 The data show that amyloid-beta protofibrils and tau tangles play roles in the neurodegeneration process,2,3 and only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both amyloid plaque and protofibrils**, which can impact tau downstream. Due to the reaccumulation of AD biomarkers and return to placebo rate of decline after therapy is stopped,3-5 continuing maintenance treatment after the initial 18-month therapy is essential to slow the progression of AD and extend the therapeutic benefits, helping patients maintain who they are for longer.

In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 982,000 people are living with dementia,6 and AD is the cause in 60-70% of people with dementia.7 These numbers are expected to rise, as the population ages.6,7

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Apolipoprotein E is a protein involved in the metabolism of lipid in humans. It is implicated in AD. People with only one (heterozygous) or no copy (non-carriers) of the ApoE ε4 gene are less likely to experience ARIA than people with two ApoE ε4 copies (homozygous).8

** Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms.3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially slowing the progression of AD.4

[TITLE]FDA approves ziftomenib for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with a NPM1 mutation:
[TEXT]
On November 13, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration approved ziftomenib (Komzifti, Kura Oncology, Inc.), a menin inhibitor, for adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

Full prescribing information for Komzifti will be posted on Drugs@FDA.

Efficacy and Safety

Efficacy was evaluated in KO-MEN-001 (NCT04067336), an open-label, single, arm, multicenter trial in 112 adults with relapsed or refractory AML with an NPM1 mutation identified using next-generation sequencing or polymerase chain reaction. Patients with NPM1 mutations, including Type A, B, and D mutations and other NPM1 mutations likely to result in cytoplasmic localization of the NPM1 protein, were enrolled.

Efficacy was established based on the rate of complete remission (CR) plus CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh), the duration of CR+CRh, and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. The median follow-up was 4.2 months (range, 0.1 to 41.2 months). The CR+CRh rate was 21.4% (95% CI: 14.2, 30.2) and the duration of CR+CRh was 5 months (95% CI: 1.9, 8.1). The CR rate was 17.0% (95% CI: 10.5, 25.2), and the CRh rate was 4.5% (95% CI: 1.5, 10.1). Among the 66 patients who were dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 14 (21.2%) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day post-baseline period. Of the 46 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline, 12 (26.1%) patients remained transfusion independent during any 56-day post-baseline period.

[TITLE]Salarius Pharmaceuticals and Decoy Therapeutics Complete Merger:
[TEXT]
Strategic transaction supports the advancement of Decoy’s rapid computational design and manufacturing of innovative peptide conjugate therapeutics through its IMP3ACT™ platform

Combined company has pro forma cash of $14 million following merger and closing of recent public offering

HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SLRX) (“Salarius” or the “Company”) and Decoy Therapeutics (“Decoy”) announce the completion of their strategic merger with the combined company now focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

“I’d like to thank both the Salarius and Decoy teams for their hard work and dedication in completing this transaction, which supports the advancement of next-generation therapeutics through our proprietary IMP3ACT Platform,” said Frederick “Rick” Pierce, Chief Executive Officer of Salarius and former Chief Executive Officer of Decoy. “By combining artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and high-speed synthesis techniques, we rapidly design, engineer and manufacture peptide conjugate drug candidates that target serious unmet medical needs. Our technology and innovations in manufacturing allow for advancing new therapies from lab to clinic to commercialization with unprecedented speed. We anticipate multiple value-creating inflection points in the coming year, initially targeting unmet needs in respiratory infectious diseases and gastroenterology (GI) oncology indications.”

Prior to this merger, Decoy attracted financing from institutional investors as well as significant non-dilutive capital from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Seed Fund, the Google AI startup program and the NVIDIA Inception program, among other sources. Decoy also received QuickFire Challenge award funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) through BLUE KNIGHT™, a legacy collaboration between Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS and BARDA within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

[TITLE]“LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) IV Maintenance Dosing for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease Approved in the United Kingdom:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that humanized anti- soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody “LEQEMBI®” (generic name: lecanemab) has been approved for once every four weeks intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom.

In August 2024, LEQEMBI was approved for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in adult patients that are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4)* heterozygotes or non-carriers in the United Kingdom. With this latest approval for IV maintenance dosing, after 18 months of a dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks patients may be transitioned to the maintenance dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg once every four weeks, or the regimen of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks may be continued.

AD is a progressive, relentless disease characterized by formation of protein deposits known as plaques made of amyloid-beta aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles made of tau protein in the brains of people living with AD. It is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process that begins before amyloid plaque accumulation and continues after plaque removal.1,2 The data show that amyloid-beta protofibrils and tau tangles play roles in the neurodegeneration process,2,3 and only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both amyloid plaque and protofibrils**, which can impact tau downstream. Due to the reaccumulation of AD biomarkers and return to placebo rate of decline after therapy is stopped,3-5 continuing maintenance treatment after the initial 18-month therapy is essential to slow the progression of AD and extend the therapeutic benefits, helping patients maintain who they are for longer.

In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 982,000 people are living with dementia,6 and AD is the cause in 60-70% of people with dementia.7 These numbers are expected to rise, as the population ages.6,7

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Apolipoprotein E is a protein involved in the metabolism of lipid in humans. It is implicated in AD. People with only one (heterozygous) or no copy (non-carriers) of the ApoE ε4 gene are less likely to experience ARIA than people with two ApoE ε4 copies (homozygous).8

** Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms.3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially slowing the progression of AD.4

[TITLE]TAR-200 implant: A game-changer for bladder cancer? – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
TAR-200 implant: A game-changer for bladder cancer?

A pretzel-shaped drug-releasing implant (TAR-200) achieved an 82 percent complete response rate in eliminating bladder cancer tumors, with 76 percent of patients remaining tumor-free after one year. It offers a less invasive alternative to bladder removal surgery and traditional chemotherapy.

Unlike conventional chemo (high doses with severe side effects), the implant slowly releases chemotherapy directly into the bladder over six months, minimizing systemic toxicity. It is currently under FDA Priority Review.

Andreas Moritz argues that chemo damages healthy cells, breeding more aggressive cancers, and emphasizes that true healing depends on strengthening the body’s natural defenses rather than toxic interventions.

Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Delaware synthesized cancer-fighting molecules from guava plants, targeting liver cancer. Natural compounds like flavonoids, curcuminoids and polyphenols enhance immune function, inhibit tumor growth and avoid harming healthy cells – unlike chemo.

While the TAR-200 implant represents progress in conventional medicine, plant-based therapies (backed by studies) offer safer, synergistic treatments that align with the body's healing mechanisms, signaling a shift toward integrative cancer care.

In a groundbreaking development, a small, drug-releasing implant has shown remarkable success in treating high-risk bladder cancer.

The TAR-200 implant, developed by Massachusetts-based TARIS Biomedical, has wiped out tumors in roughly four-fifths of patients, offering a promising alternative to invasive surgery and traditional chemotherapy. The results of a clinical trial focused on the implant were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

In the aforementioned clinical trial involving 140 patients, the TAR-200 implant demonstrated a complete response rate of 82 percent, meaning it eliminated all visible tumors. Moreover, 76 percent of patients remained tumor-free after one year. These results suggest that the implant could replace or delay the need for bladder removal surgery in many patients.

The pretzel-shaped TAR-200 implant works by slowly and consistently releasing chemotherapy directly into the bladder over a period of six months. This approach contrasts with traditional treatments, which deliver high doses of chemotherapy in short periods, often leading to severe side effects. It is currently under Priority Review by the Food and Drug Administration, highlighting its potential to transform bladder cancer treatment.

But Andreas Moritz, in his book "Cancer Is Not a Disease - It's a Healing Mechanism," casts doubt on the effectiveness of chemotherapy. "[Damaging] healthy cells in the process of destroying cancer cells through chemotherapy drugs or radiation is bound to breed new, more aggressive cancer cells," he writes. "The only real chance of surviving cancer depends on the amount of support the patient musters to strengthen the body's own healing efforts."

Forget chemo: Plant-based compounds show stunning success against the Big C

While the TAR-200 implant represents a significant advancement in conventional cancer treatment, it is essential to acknowledge the potential of natural and holistic approaches. Recent research has shown promising results in using plant-derived compounds to combat liver cancer.

For instance, scientists at the University of Delaware (UDel) have synthesized cancer-fighting molecules from guava plants to target liver cancer. In a study published in Angewandte Chemie, researchers elaborated how they made use of a process called natural product total synthesis to create these solutions to the Big C.

"The majority of clinically approved medicines are either made from a natural product or are based on one," said UDel's Dr. William Chain, the study's corresponding author. "But there aren't enough natural resources to make enough treatments. Now chemists will be able to take our manuscripts and basically follow our 'recipe' and they can make it themselves."

While the study by Chain and his co-authors focus on the guava molecule's effect on liver cancer, they are now working with the National Cancer Institute for this purpose. Nevertheless, their research is timely – with one in 125 people globally projected to be diagnosed with liver cancer over their lifetime.

BrightU.AI's Enoch engine points out that natural, plant-based treatments for cancer work synergistically with the body's own defenses – enhancing immune function and targeting tumors without harming healthy cells – unlike chemotherapy, which indiscriminately destroys both cancerous and healthy tissue. Additionally, these natural compounds – such as flavonoids, curcuminoids and polyphenols – offer fewer toxic side effects while still effectively inhibiting cancer growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, aligning with the body's innate healing processes.

While the success of the TAR-200 implant is laudable, advancements in natural and holistic therapies offer hope for cancer patients and survivors. As research into the latter, continues to grow, patients and healthcare providers alike can expect an increasingly diverse and effective toolkit for combating cancer.
