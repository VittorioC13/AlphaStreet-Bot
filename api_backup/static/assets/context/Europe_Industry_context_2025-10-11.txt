[TITLE]Unlocking the Longevity Dividend for Growth and Resilience:
[TEXT]
For much of the post-war era, economic analysis of population aging has focused overwhelmingly on its downsides. The dominant framing, especially in aging advanced economies like Japan, Italy and Germany, has been one of demographic doom. Many people frequently cast falling fertility rates, rising life expectancy and inverted population pyramids as existential threats to economic growth, fiscal solvency and societal dynamism. This deterministic narrative posits a future of too few workers supporting too many retirees, with escalating burdens on public pension systems, healthcare and intergenerational equity. Governments receive warnings of collapsing labor markets, declining productivity and irreversible economic stagnation.

However, this framing, while not wholly without basis, is ultimately incomplete and outdated. It ignores both the changing nature of aging and the vast adaptive capacity of institutions, individuals and markets. As empirical evidence accumulates, a more optimistic counter-narrative emerges — one in which longer lives, better health at older ages and rising educational attainment among older cohorts unlock new economic potential. This is the essence of the longevity dividend: a window of opportunity where demographic change becomes a driver of renewal, rather than decline.

For example, in the European Union, more than 90% of net employment growth in the past decade was generated by workers aged 50 and above. In Japan, where the median age exceeds 48, older cohorts are now a primary driver of GDP growth. These trends underscore a critical point: Aging populations are not necessarily shrinking productive populations. With the right investments, institutional redesign and regulatory flexibility, the economic contributions of older individuals can be extended, diversified and even deepened.

Rethinking dependency: from burden to adaptation strategy

Most public policy responses to demographic aging today remain anchored in a framework of dependency. Policymakers scramble to shore up old-age support systems through three conventional levers: raising retirement ages, incentivizing childbirth and expanding immigration. Each faces steep political, economic or social resistance. Raising the retirement age provokes popular backlash, particularly when unaccompanied by workplace reform. Fertility incentives have failed in many countries — South Korea, for instance, spends over 2% of GDP on family subsidies with little reversal in birth trends. Immigration, while economically effective in some settings, is politically fraught and socially complex.

What unites these strategies is their reactive posture. They seek to preserve 20th-century social models built for younger, growing populations in a 21st-century world of demographic maturity. They treat aging as a problem to be reversed or slowed, not as a condition to which society should strategically adapt.

This is a missed opportunity. Rather than simply adjusting age ratios, forward-thinking societies should invest in capabilities across the life course. That includes designing systems that maintain health, skills, productivity and social engagement well into the eighth and ninth decades of life.

This adaptation framework necessitates new thinking

[TITLE]Meeting of 10-11 September 2025:
[TEXT]
Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11 September 2025

1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options

Financial market developments

Ms Schnabel started her presentation by noting that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 23-24 July 2025, interest rate markets in the euro area and the United States had been pulled in different directions, leading to a convergence of policy rate expectations. In the euro area, expectations for interest rates had shifted higher, with reduced uncertainty around the rate outlook, as a consensus had formed that interest rates were currently in a “good place” and close to or at the end of the monetary policy cycle. Markets had fully priced out any rate cut at the current meeting and assigned a significantly lower probability to another 25 basis point rate cut by year-end. The median participant in the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts anticipated no further rate cuts in 2025, while the median respondent in both the Bloomberg and Reuters surveys did not expect any further rate cut in the current cycle. In the United States, market expectations of a quicker easing cycle had increased after weak labour market data. As a result, the gap between the one-year rate one year ahead in the euro area and the United States had narrowed to its lowest level since September 2024.

The bulk of the adjustment in market expectations for ECB monetary policy since June 2025 had occurred after the Governing Council’s June and July monetary policy meetings, which had been interpreted as signalling that no further rate cuts were imminent. Subsequent data releases had confirmed and reinforced this new baseline path. Moreover, uncertainty around the expected rate path had decreased. This stood in contrast to developments in the United States, where option-implied probabilities suggested that US rate uncertainty remained elevated.

The key fundamental driver of the gradual convergence in policy rate expectations had been the narrowing gap in the economic outlook between the euro area and the United States. Consensus Economics growth expectations for the euro area in 2025 were now well above their levels prior to the US tariff announcement on 2 April, and expectations for 2026 had declined only mildly. By contrast, growth expectations for the United States for both 2025 and 2026 had been revised down sharply. Developments in the inflation outlook seemed to be less in line with the converging rate outlook. In the euro area, investors’ inflation expectations had stabilised at around the ECB’s inflation target. By contrast, medium-term inflation compensation in the United States had trended higher after the drop in April, despite the substantial downward revision in US growth expectations over the same period.

Market pricing of looser US monetary policy could be explained by pointing to the fact that, over the past year, US interest rates had become far more sensitive to surprises in US non-farm employment figures than in previous years. Sensitivity to US inflation surprises had, however, fallen to close to zero, indicating that investor focus in the United States had shifted towards real economic data.

In the euro area, medium and longer-term interest rates had remained broadly stable over recent months. In the United States, the slight decline in the ten-year rate since April 2025 had been due to offsetting factors. Investors expected a more accommodative monetary policy stance in the United States, but at the same time demanded higher compensation for the various risks surrounding that scenario, including potential risks to US public debt sustainability.

Yields on 30-year bonds had reached historically high levels in some advanced economies. This had contributed to a steepening of the yield curve at the very long end. However, from a longer-term perspective, this steepening appeared to be a normalisation after a long period of compressed term premia, as yield curves remained much less steep than before the start of large-scale asset purchases across most major central banks.

In spite of the narrowing interest rate differential, the exchange rate had remained broadly constant. The largest part of the appreciation of the euro in 2025 could be explained by relative demand and sentiment. Important drivers of exchange rate developments had been the announcements of tariffs and the subsequent trade agreements. A comparison of bilateral exchange rate movements of a broad set of currencies against the US dollar showed that the initial depreciation of the US dollar against almost all currencies after the April tariff announcement had been followed by an appreciation after the July tariff agreements, partly reversing the April moves.

Despite political uncertainty in France, sovereign bond spreads vis-à-vis the German Bund had remained range-bound for euro area countries, with the euro area GDP-weighted sovereign spread having steadily declined since its peak in the autumn of 2022. The dispersion of ten-year sovereign spreads across euro area countries stood at its lowest level since 2007, before the global financial crisis. This showed that fragmentation in euro area sovereign bond markets had declined in spite of the ongoing reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet and higher short and long-term rates.

One factor supporting euro area government bond markets had been the renewed interest of foreign investors. Since Eurosystem net asset purchases had ended, the euro area had seen a sharp increase in foreign inflows. Two main factors explained this renewed foreign demand for euro area assets. First, euro area government bonds currently offered more attractive yields than US Treasuries or Japanese government bonds when adjusted for currency hedging costs. Second, the narrowing gap in the economic outlook between the euro area and the United States as well as concerns

[TITLE]War for Ukraine Day 1,323: Putin Long Tried To Control Ukraine's Natural Gas Industry, Now He Seaks To Destroy It:

The cost:

On Sept 28, a russian drone killed nurse Oksana Katerusha from the Kyiv cardiology institute. Following protocols, all patients and staff moved to the shelter when the air raid began. But one man’s condition deteriorated there. Oksana took the risk & went upstairs to help & there both were killed.

Russian strikes have destroyed more than half of Ukraine’s natural gas production capacity ahead of winter, Bloomberg reported; Ukrainian forces struck a Russian gas plant and an oil pipeline station in Russia’s Volgograd Oblast; and more.

From The Kyiv Independent:

Russian strikes have destroyed more than half of Ukraine’s natural gas production capacity ahead of winter, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Ukraine’s gas network, which met the country’s needs before the full-scale war, has been repeatedly hit by missiles and drones, endangering millions of households that depend on gas for heating in winter. Russian forces launched one of the largest barrages yet on Oct. 3, firing 35 missiles and 60 drones at gas facilities in Kharkiv and Poltava oblasts, according to state-owned energy company Naftogaz. The strikes destroyed around 60% of Ukraine’s gas production, Bloomberg’s sources said. Naftogaz called the attack “the most massive” assault on gas infrastructure since the war began. Ukraine’s largest private energy firm, DTEK, said it was forced to halt operations at its Poltava facilities following the strikes. Two days later, Russia launched another attack targeting infrastructure critical for residential heating, causing further destruction, Naftogaz said. The strikes show Moscow’s strategy of targeting energy infrastructure to weaken civilian morale. Since 2022, Russia has repeatedly aimed to disrupt Ukraine’s heating and power systems with attacks. According to Bloomberg, Kyiv appealed to its G7 partners for urgent equipment to repair damaged facilities and reiterated its requests for additional air defense systems to protect energy infrastructure.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas giant Naftogaz with fresh financing for emergency gas imports amid devastating Russian strikes on its gas production facilities, the bank’s vice president said on Oct. 9. [image or embed] — The Kyiv Independent (@kyivindependent.com) October 9, 2025 at 4:02 PM

The Kyiv Independent has the details:

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas giant Naftogaz with fresh financing for emergency gas imports amid devastating Russian strikes on its gas production facilities, the bank’s vice president told the Kyiv Independent in an interview on Oct. 9. Nearly 60% of the country’s gas production was damaged in recent strikes, which targeted Ukraine’s Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 9, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. Naftogaz and Ukraine’s Energy Ministry did not confirm the damage to the Kyiv Independent. Naftogaz did say, however, that the recent strikes were as bad as attacks in February and March. Those attacks led to a loss of nearly 50% of its gas production, the company said then. The EBRD program, which is currently in the works, needs to be up and running in the next two months for Ukraine to be able to import enough gas for the winter, Matteo Patrone, the bank’s VP, said. Patrone declined to publicly comment on how much funding would be provided, as the bank is still running the numbers. The bank recently provided the oil and gas giant with a 500-million-euro package in August — its largest project ever in Ukraine — after reserves dropped to an 11-year low in May. Ukraine needs at least 13.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to heat homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses this heating season. Before the latest attacks upturned its winter strategy, Naftogaz had planned to import 5.8 bcm by the end of the year, with nearly 4.6 bcm purchased already, the company’s press service told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian state-owned bank Oschadbank signed a 3 billion hryvnia ($72 million) loan with Naftogaz for gas imports on Oct. 9. The European Investment Bank allotted 300 million euros ($347 million) to shore up reserves on Oct. 1. “We stand ready to lead this effort, but it has to be a collective effort. International partners and the Ukrainian banking system have to step up. We all need to contribute,” Patrone said. With the right support from the domestic financial sector and international partners, there will be enough gas in the system to get through the winter, he said.

Putin spent years controlling Ukraine’s natural gas industry through the Ukrainian oligarch and organized crime leader Dmytro Firtash. Firtash has spent years under house arrest in Austria as his extradition appeal slowly grinds through the Austrian court system. Firtash was also an important bridging node between Putin and Russian organized crime and Trump via Rudy Giuliani and Victoria Toensing.

Putin ultimately failed to take control of Ukraine’s natural gas industry, so he’s decided to destroy it to both further his attempt to terrorize the Ukrainians into submission and to remove Ukrainian natural gas from the European and world markets. His intention in achieving the latter is that it will both raise the price of natural gas and make the European states have to start buying Russian natural gas again. An additional effect is to burden Ukraine with more debt that will make it harder to secure the post war peace.

Here is President Zelenskyy’s address from earlier today. Video below, English transcript after the jump.

The Task Now Is to Be Significantly More Active in Everything Related to the Preparation and Execution of Long-Range Sanctions Against Russia – Address by the President I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! The main points for today. Military issues. We discussed in great detail with the military leadership the employment of our long-range weapons – the use of our missiles, the use of our drones. Some issues concerning production, delivery to the armed forces, and crew training. The task now is to be significantly more active in everything related to the preparation and execution of long-range sanctions against Russia. The more effective Ukraine is in long-range capabilities, the sooner we will be able to achieve peace. The quality of Ukrainian long-range weapons is becoming substantially higher – we are working on this constantly, and we have already provided many different opportunities specifically for production, the necessary funding, and all the support required. We must also substantially scale up their employment. We have clear plans for this in the coming months. Everything must be implemented. Ukrainian precision is already evident, it needs to increase further. This is absolutely fair that Ukraine strikes back with precise, targeted attacks, and unlike Russia, we know exactly what we aim to achieve. Peace, of course. We are not waging war for the sake of war, as Russia does. Even Hamas shows deal-making acumen, but not Putin. For now. Together with our partners, we are creating the conditions to compel Russia to peace. And it will happen. We support all global diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving peace in the Middle East, and we strongly expect that just pressure on Russia will bring peace to Ukraine and to our entire region as well. It is important that the leadership of the United States continue to be effective. Today, I held a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and the diplomatic team of the Office to discuss the drafts of our resolutions and documents in international organizations that are to be adopted later this year. I instructed them to engage partners to the fullest extent possible, our key partners, to ensure continued global support for our initiatives. This concerns, in particular, such sensitive issues as the return of Ukrainian prisoners, all those held in Russia. And we know of people who have been in captivity since 2014. This also concerns the children abducted by Russia – time is passing far too quickly, and it is not just every year but every month that matters for each child separated from their family and from their native environment – from Ukraine. We know a lot

[TITLE]Everything Is Becoming a Bank:
[TEXT]
Jacobin ‘s fall issue, “Borders,” is out now. Follow this link to get a discounted subscription to our beautiful print quarterly.

The US economy is turning into one giant bank. Starbucks holds nearly $2 billion of customers’ money in its rewards program. That’s more than the total deposits managed by 85 percent of chartered banks, making the coffee chain one of the biggest financial institutions in the country. Conversely, Capital One, one of the world’s top banks, now operates its own cafes on city street corners. Airlines are now little more than flying banks, given that they make more money from selling frequent-flyer points to credit card companies than they do flying passengers. More Americans than ever are in debt to their nearby grocery store due to predatory “buy now, pay later” loans offered during checkout. As you’re wheeled into an emergency medical procedure, the nurse may ask if you’d prefer to pay on a deferred-payment loan plan, an increasingly common way to finance health care expenses. And if you can’t pay your rent on time, it could soon become common for your apartment building owner to lend you the money, putting you in debt to your landlord. These are snapshots of the new wave of financialization sweeping across the country, where the lines between finance and commerce are being blurred. Upward of 40 percent of Americans now pay for basic items like groceries and health care using borrowed money — and this excludes credit cards. A third of younger Americans hold their savings on nonbank tech platforms like Venmo, and industries from retail to transportation derive anywhere from 14 percent to half of their profits from partnerships with credit card companies. While this new type of financialization takes many different forms, the endgame is the same: Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. Banks operating credit cards are the highest-profit-margin enterprises in the economy. Every company wants a share of the loot, amassed from high fees and low overhead costs. This development has been supercharged by the Silicon Valley investor class, under the Orwellian term “embedded finance.” Others call it “bankification.” The peddlers of embedded finance promise a world of “frictionless transactions,” providing consumers efficiency and convenience by integrating financial and nonfinancial services. Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. But these new profit streams come with a range of potential harms. Financial policy watchdogs warn that bankification is unleashing predatory and fraudulent practices onto consumers, workers, and smaller businesses. It may even lay the groundwork for the next financial collapse. After all, can a widget factory be trusted to manage customers’ money and make safe lending decisions without putting the entire financial system at risk? During the Biden administration, regulators launched rules and investigations to limit corporations’ new banking ambitions. But those actions have since been terminated by the Trump administration, which has signaled that it will instead open up new channels for this fusion of finance and commerce to proceed — an experiment that could prove disastrous for the country. Bankification “encapsulates so much of what we should have learned [from 2008] and what could go wrong,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University and author of the book Taming the Megabanks: Why We Need a New Glass-Steagall Act, which warns

[TITLE]Can France learn from Italy to overcome its fiscal crisis? – DW – 10:
[TEXT]
France's political and economic crisis is deepening. Governments keep falling, budgets can't be agreed and the country's debt pile keeps expanding. Can it learn anything from reformed problem child Italy?

France's political crisis shows no sign of abating. The resignation of Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister this week, after just 27 days in office, means the country is set to have an eighth prime minister in the space of five years.

Although President Emmanuel Macron now looks set to name another prime minister before the week is over — potentially fending off the need for new elections — the political turmoil comes with major consequences for the EU's second-largest economy.

As happened in 2024, it means the 2026 budget may not be agreed in time to be debated and passed by the end of the year. Last year, the budget was "rolled over" into 2025 due to political instability, meaning the old budget was used until a new budget was finally agreed in February.

Although that short-term solution prevents the risk of a US-style government shutdown, it does nothing to deal with France's long-term economic problems, namely its debt and public finances.

The debt problem

In the aftermath of the latest prime minister resignation, rating agencies issued fresh warnings
