[TITLE]US Open offers home court advantage to top brands:

Thomas URBAIN

The US Open, the last Grand Slam of the tennis calendar, has become a coveted money-making opportunity for the world’s top brands, in everything from banking to ice cream, generating hundreds of millions of dollars.

Last year, the event run by the US Tennis Association posted revenue of $560 million, a record for a tennis tournament and more than double the figure from 10 years before.

Ticket sales are the USTA’s primary source of income, but broadcast rights could soon surpass that, with a new 11-year contract with Disney’s ESPN Group worth more than $2 billion coming into effect in 2026.

For consumer brands, “the US Open is arguably the most visible tennis tournament and it’s also taking place in a city that’s known for fashion and trends,” said Patrick Rishe, a professor of sports business at the University of Washington in St. Louis.

The two-week event — attended by a constellation of stars from actors to sports icons — is especially key for athletic wear and gear makers, as well as regular fashion labels, “to make a splash, because it’s a global stage,” Rishe explained.

Venerable US fashion house Ralph Lauren, a US Open partner for the past 21 years, dresses the tournament’s chair umpires as well as the ball boys and girls. But it also has a shop on site.

“The US Open is truly unique,” said David Lauren, the company’s chief branding and innovation officer.

“It’s more than just a tennis tournament — it’s a New York moment,” he added. “The energy of this city has always been part of our brand.”

And Flushing Meadows is not only a playground for major labels.

One of the sensations of the tournament was American Taylor Townsend, who advanced to the round of 16 in singles, and is the world’s top-ranked doubles player.

She also ended up in a major post-match beef with an opponent — all while wearing new offerings from her own TT label, launched this summer after she struggled to secure an apparel deal with mainstream brands.

“The response has been incredible. The goal is to scale the brand,” said Alexander-John, the designer collaborating with the 29-year-old Townsend.

– Exclusivity –

The opportunity is of course not limited to fashion brands.

Within the jam-packed Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, the throng is drinking Aperol spritzes or sipping Moet et Chandon champagne — or the ubiquitous Honey Deuce, the drink of the season made with Grey Goose vodka.

Thousands of drinks are sold each year, and with the Honey Deuce coming in at $23 a glass, it’s a marketing bonanza.

“Part of the appeal of the US Open is the exclusivity — special experiences, limited-time offerings, and iconic food and beverage items,” said a spokesman for ice cream maker Van Leeuwen, which created the “Honeycomb Fudge Slam” for the occasion.

High-end jeweler Tiffany and watchmaker Rolex are key sponsors with an on-site presence.

Tennis is an “affluent sport that attracts a more affluent socioeconomic demographic,” said Rishe.

“Especially for some of the higher end apparel, fashion, travel lines, this is an opportunity for them to connect with consumers that might generate higher revenue per customer.”

JPMorgan Chase, which has sponsored the tournament for 44 years, makes the most of the event, setting up a dedicated space reserved for clients, including private meeting areas.

“It is truly a great opportunity for us to engage fans and customers, as well as host clients over the course of the tournament,” said a spokesman for the US banking giant.

In a bid to maximize revenues, the USTA made some changes to boost attendance at sessions ahead of the tournament’s main draw, which traditionally is devoted to qualifying rounds and hence sees smaller crowds.

This year, a new mixed doubles format was introduced, featuring singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic who do not usually participate in doubles events alongside lesser known doubles specialists.

The move should help smash last year’s record attendance of 1.04 million people. At last count, with four days to go, official attendance already stood at 986,000.

[TITLE]SECURITIES CLASS ACTION NOTICE: Girard Sharp Law Firm Encourages Current and Former 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) Shareholders Who Received Neogen Corporation (NASDAQ:NEOG) Shares in Connection With Neogen Co:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Girard Sharp LLP, a national investment, securities, and consumer class action law firm, has filed a securities class action against Neogen Corporation (“Neogen”). According to the complaint, the class includes “all current and former 3M shareholders who received NEOG common stock in exchange for Garden SpinCo shares pursuant to the Merger Exchange (the “Class”)”.

Neogen is a Michigan corporation that, with its subsidiaries, “manufacture and market a diverse line of products and services dedicated to food and animal safety.” The Company’s Food Safety segment consists primarily of “diagnostic test products and complementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns.” The Company’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the “development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, diagnostic products, rodenticides, cleaners, disinfectants, insecticides and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal safety market.”

The offering materials for the Merger (“Offering Materials”) stated that the combined Company expected to “have improved EBITDA margins and stronger free cash flow relative to Neogen on a standalone basis, allowing Neogen to deleverage following the [Merger]” and “generate run-rate revenue and cost synergies of $30 million within three years following the closing of the [Merger] due to efficiencies in product innovation, sales, marketing, distribution and production.”

On January 10, 2025, Neogen announced its preliminary 2Q25 financial results and reported a net loss of $456.3 million due to a non-cash goodwill impairment related to the 3M Food Safety Division acquisition. Moreover, Neogen reported that, as of November 30, 2024, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. On April 9, 2025, Neogen announced its 3Q25 financial results, reporting a net loss of $11 million and a drop in revenue of 3.4% to $221 million. The Company also reported that its capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $100 million as a result of “lowered Adjusted EBITDA” and a “pull-forward of integration capex into fiscal 2025.” It also reported the Company’s CEO, John Adent, would be stepping down.

Since September 1, 2022, the date upon which Neogen issued shares to former or current 3M investors, Neogen’s share price has declined by 75%. Girard Sharp’s investigation focuses on whether the Offering Materials may have included misrepresentations and omissions regarding Neogen’s and 3M’s financial conditions and the Merger.

[TITLE]Penn State set to begin 'transformational' apparel deal with adidas:
[TEXT]
AI-assisted summary Penn State announced a 10-year partnership with adidas, ending its relationship with Nike.

The new deal will begin on July 1, 2026, and will outfit all 31 varsity sports programs.

Reports suggest the "transformational" agreement could be worth as much as $300 million.

Penn State is becoming an adidas school, after all.

University officials announced a "transformational" 10-year deal with adidas Friday as its official uniform, footwear and apparel partner − ending their more than three-decades relationship with Nike. The new deal begins July 1, 2026, the first day of Penn State's fiscal year.

Though Penn State did not release financial details, reports, like this one from the Centre Daily Times, say it could be worth as much as $300 million. Adidas will outfit each of Penn State's varsity athletic programs as well as produce merchandise for sale.

"Today, we step into a bold new era," is how Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft described the deal in a university news release.

"This partnership goes far beyond uniforms, it is unlike anything else in the marketplace. Adidas is making an unprecedented commitment to Penn State: delivering record investment in our department, groundbreaking NIL and marketing opportunities and access to technology and innovation that no other program can match.

"This agreement sets a new industry standard ..."

Penn State and adidas "will be prioritizing high-impact NIL agreements and brand marketing campaigns" for athletes in each of its 31 varsity sports, according to the release.

Earlier this summer, adidas continued its push deeper into the college apparel market by signing with the Tennessee Volunteers.

"We see this new agreement as a unique opportunity for us to help shape the next chapter of Penn State athletics while staying true to everything that makes the Nittany Lions an iconic brand," adidas president John Miller said in the release.

Of course, the impending apparel shift will be a dramatic change for many Penn State fans, who have been buying PSU Nike sports gear designs for more than 30 years.

It's also the latest in a growing line of significant athletic department moves since Kraft took over three years ago. They include hiring the first outside food vendor for PSU athletic venues (Oak View Group), replacing the university's media rights partner (PlayFly over Learfield) and starting an athletic department content subscription service (ROAR+).

Kraft, of course, also is overseeing the ongoing $700 million Beaver Stadium renovations.

Penn State agreed to a $50 million field-naming rights change − West Shore Home at Beaver Stadium − to help fund the project.
