[TEXT]
Global Strategy Enters New Phase via Setting Up Middle East Headquarters​​

Dubai, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lianhe Sowell International Group Ltd. (the “Company”, NASDAQ: LHSW) today announced that it has signed a $105 million financing non-binding frame agreement (the “Term Sheet”) with Excellent Capital Investments (ECI), a European infrastructure investment fund. The potential proceeds will be used exclusively to establish the Company’s first artificial intelligence-powered robot manufacturing and research and development base in the United Arab Emirates (the “Project”), marking a significant step in Lianhe Sowell’s global intelligent manufacturing strategy.

Pursuant to the Term Sheet, total investment in the Project is estimated to be approximately $132.5 million. Lianhe Sowell will contribute 20% of the Project investment as cornerstone investment, while ECI will provide the remaining 80%, or $105 million in the form of structured senior secured credit support. The partnership underscores strong recognition from international capital markets of Lianhe Sowell’s technical expertise and global operational capabilities. The Term Sheet remains subject to due diligence, documentation, and final approval.

A New Chapter for Chinese High-End Manufacturing Expansion in UAE​

As a Nasdaq-listed provider of advanced manufacturing and AI solutions, Lianhe Sowell is committed to driving innovation in intelligent manufacturing, robotic automation, and AI-enabled industrial applications. The UAE Project represents a key milestone in the Company’s globalization strategy and serves as a benchmark for high-end Chinese manufacturing expanding overseas. Strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Europe, and Africa, the UAE offers geographic advantages and a business-friendly environment. Lianhe Sowell will leverage this opportunity to build an integrated AI robot base encompassing R&D, production, sales, and export operations, further strengthening its global industrial chain presence.

Driving Industrial Upgrading in the UAE, Boosting Regional Economy and Innovation

Lianhe Sowell estimates the Project construction period will be around 18 months. Upon completion, the manufacturing and R&D base is expected to have an annual output of several thousand AI robots annually and create more than 2,000 high-skill local jobs. Lianhe Sowell also plans to establish a robotics technology training and certification center to support local talent development and promote industrial automation and green manufacturing across the Middle East. The AI painting robots will be deployed across a range of sectors, including automotive, construction, aviation, rail transportation, marine, and new energy, supporting the UAE’s “Industry 4.0” strategy with advanced technology and expertise.

Dual-Engine Growth: Finance and Technology

Looking ahead, this financing marks Lianhe Sowell’s official entry into a new phase of international intelligent manufacturing and underscores the UAE’s growing role as a key node in the global AI manufacturing ecosystem.

The Company stated that it will use this initiative as a starting point to further expand its presence across the Middle East and Global market, and to advance global collaboration in the automation industry chain. This is not merely a financing partnership—it represents a redefinition of the global industrial landscape. By deeply integrating global capital, technology, and market resources, and with UAE as its strategic hub, Lianhe Sowell aims to showcase Chinese smart manufacturing on the international stage.

[TITLE]Fortrea Holdings (FTRE): Valuation Update Following Debt Tender Offer and Ongoing Capital Restructuring:
[TEXT]
Fortrea Holdings (FTRE) has announced the start of a debt tender offer to repurchase part of its outstanding senior secured notes, following through on commitments linked to prior business divestitures. This move highlights ongoing efforts to manage its capital structure and reduce future obligations.

See our latest analysis for Fortrea Holdings.

After months of heavy selling, Fortrea Holdings' share price has staged a remarkable comeback, soaring more than 66% in the past 90 days. Although the 1-year total shareholder return is still down nearly 35%, the recent surge suggests momentum is building as investors reassess risks and the company responds proactively to restructuring commitments.

If you’re wondering what else might be gathering steam, this is the moment to broaden your search with fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.

But with shares still far below their recent highs, the key question is whether Fortrea Holdings is undervalued in light of ongoing restructuring, or if the market is already factoring in its next stage of growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 19.7% Overvalued

The current fair value estimate stands at $9.44 per share, which is notably below the previous close of $11.30, as analysts reset expectations following recent guidance changes and market signals. This gap is fueling debate on whether the market is pricing in an optimistic future or overlooking key risks.

“Bullish analysts have raised price targets for Fortrea, citing signs of stabilization in contract research organization demand. This supports a more positive valuation outlook.”

Read the complete narrative.

Think analysts are too bullish? The narrative hinges on massive revenue acceleration and a swing in profit margins the market has not seen yet. Ready to see which wild assumptions could flip this story? Dive in and uncover the drivers that set this punchy valuation.

Result: Fair Value of $9.44 (OVERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, persistent customer concentration and competitive industry pressures could easily challenge this optimistic scenario if large clients shift spending or if market dynamics worsen.

Find out about the key risks to this Fortrea Holdings narrative.

Another View: Is the Market Missing Something?

While the first valuation approach signals overvaluation, taking a look at the company’s price-to-sales ratio paints a far more attractive picture. Fortrea Holdings trades at just 0.4x sales, a deep discount compared to the industry average of 3.6x and the peer average of 5.3x. Even the fair ratio stands at 1.6x. This suggests significant potential upside if the market re-rates the stock. Does this wide gap highlight a rare opportunity or a warning to dig deeper before jumping in?

[TITLE]Orchid Island Capital (ORC) Profitability Returns; Premium Valuation Challenges Sustainability Narratives:
[TEXT]
This reliance on frequent equity fundraising stands out given the company’s exclusive focus on agency RMBS and its relatively undiversified revenue streams, which may leave it more vulnerable should sector conditions worsen.

Repeated equity issuance, even when slightly accretive, can cap long-term EPS growth and make sustained dividend payouts harder to support if internally generated capital lags.

The consensus narrative flags the risk that recurring capital raises may dilute existing shareholders’ returns even as earnings rise.

Analysts forecast Orchid Island Capital will expand its shares outstanding by approximately 7.0% per year for the next three years, highlighting the ongoing role of equity raises in the business plan.

Wider spreads over swaps and low market volatility have created an environment to acquire attractive assets and hedge effectively. Analysts believe both of these factors position Orchid Island Capital for a significant increase in profitability.

According to the analysts' consensus view, management’s portfolio strategies and the current market’s historically wide mortgage spreads could support this margin expansion.

Analysts expect profit margins at Orchid Island Capital to surge from 26.4% today to an impressive 99.0% within three years, pointing to dramatically greater earnings retained from each dollar of revenue.

Next, we’ll see how these headline results compare to the prevailing narratives in the market and whether the data supports or upends expectations.

Orchid Island Capital (ORC) has achieved profitability over the past five years, delivering an average annual earnings growth of 15.6%. Most recently, it turned profitable again with its latest earnings characterized as high quality. However, shares currently trade at a pronounced premium with a Price-To-Sales Ratio of 47.8x, well above the industry average of 4.3x and the peer level of 5x. This may raise questions

[TITLE]DeLeion Capital Highlights BNB Opportunity amid Regulatory Shift and Ecosystem Renewal:
[TEXT]
San Francisco, CA, Oct. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global digital-asset custody and investment firm DeLeion Capital today calls attention to the renewed potential of the Binance ecosystem, anchored by BNB, following the recent presidential pardon of Binance CO-Founder Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”). The firm believes this development marks a pivotal turning point in crypto regulatory sentiment and presents a timely opportunity for asset-holders to partner with professional custody and management services to convert potential into performance.

Market Headwinds Turning to Opportunities

The U.S. government’s decision to pardon CZ has reverberated across the crypto ecosystem, prompting investors and institutions alike to interpret the move as a sign of weakening regulatory headwinds.

In tandem, BNB experienced a sharp uptick in trading volume and breached significant technical resistance levels, an early indication that investor confidence and institutional interest are returning.

Against this backdrop, the Binance ecosystem has reclaimed fresh market attention as a core participant in the global digital-asset landscape.

Professional Custody + Strategic Asset Management:

With regulatory dynamics shifting and volatility remaining elevated, DeLeion Capital delivers a structured, team-driven approach to digital-asset growth that transcends passive “buy-and-hold.” Our platform combines:

The Fed Must Act Now – Before the Job Market Cracks

Real Clear Politics ^ | October 25, 2025 | Dan Varroney

Posted on by E. Pluribus Unum

America’s labor market is flashing red, and the Federal Reserve is watching the light change instead of hitting the brakes. Job openings have fallen to 7.26 million, the lowest level in 4½ years. Private-sector hiring has turned negative, with September’s ADP data showing -32,000 jobs after August was revised down to -3,000. Employers’ plans to add workers have plunged 71% from last year, and year-to-date hiring announcements are the weakest since 2009. The Fed must move decisively by cutting rates 50 basis points in both the October and December meetings to prevent further deterioration in employment and restore confidence to the private economy.

For the first time since early 2021, there are more unemployed Americans than job vacancies. If the Fed waits until 2026 to cut rates meaningfully, it will be too late. Monetary policy works with long and variable lags. By the time a policy shift filters through credit markets and small-business balance sheets, another million jobs could be lost.

Large corporations have the cash buffers to ride out higher rates. Small businesses do not. The Main Street employers who generate two-thirds of all new private-sector jobs and nearly 44% of U.S. GDP require lower costs of capital and a continued regulatory unwind by the Trump administration.

In “Rethinking Economic Growth,” I chronicled the real-world effects of these pressures across twelve industries, from wooden pallets to specialized transportation, energy handling, and equipment manufacturing. Each case study revealed the same truth: When financing dries up, expansion stops, hiring freezes, and communities suffer.

At Hinton Lumber in Alabama, for example, owner Hinton Howell showed how automation and AI can lift productivity if companies can access affordable capital. But when borrowing costs soar, small manufacturers can’t invest in new machinery or training. Jeff Lewis of Atlanta Pallets told...

“America’s labor market is flashing red, and the Federal Reserve is watching the light change instead of hitting the brakes. Job openings have fallen to 7.26 million, the lowest level in 4½ years.” The fed will not see this as a contracting economy, they will see it as full employment in an overheating economy and will want to raise rates or something else insane.

I believe the Fed is supposed to preserve the value of the dollar. Which they have spectacularly failed to do. Instead, the Fed is trying to manipulate employment statistics so that politicians look either good or bad, depending on the party (Democrats are the “good guys”). We ought to end the Fed.

Since 1960 at least, untested rates are quite low now. My father bought the house I grew up in, in 1963. His VA loan got him a 3% interest rate. From about 1968 until the them he sold the house in 1978 the mortgage company would ask at least twice a year for him to refinance. At 3% they said they were losing money on the loan. Credit card rates, now, are insane. I had a card I used to pay a medical bill in 2004. I was 1 day late making a payment, and Wells Cargo raised my rate from 18% to 29%. That, IMHO, is criminal, even though it’s legal. I was not able to pay off that card until 2012.

Construction company Fitzpatrick and Heavey Group has acquired PS Supplies, a family-run supplier of doors and floors based in Co Meath for €2 million.

The deal includes the transfer of 25,000 sq ft of warehouse and showroom facilities. Under the new ownership, PS Supplies, which was founded in 1986, will continue to trade under its established name and be led by general manager Brian McKenna.

The acquisition adds to a string of successful deals for Fitzpatrick and Heavey over the past two years. In March, the group merged CTS Construction and Trade Supplies with Eurometals, enhancing its distribution network across Cork and Dublin.

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
