[TITLE]Exxon Seals Massive Trinidad Oil and Gas Exploration Deal:
[TEXT]
Exxon has sealed a deal with the Trinidad and Tobago government for deepwater exploration that could involve investments of $21.7 billion, according to the Caribbean nation’s energy minister.

“What we are awarding today is larger than the surface area of the country,” Roodal Moonilat said as he broke the news of the new deal, saying the area that Exxon will explore was the size of seven normal offshore blocks.

Said area lies northwest of the Stabroek block—the offshore Guyana block that Exxon has been developing since 2005, with the first production well drilled in 2015. Since the start of exploration, Exxon has tapped an estimated 11 billion barrels in reserves and production has grown rapidly, turning Guyana into a rare hot spot in the world of oil. Plans are to pump 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2030. To date, production runs at 900,000 barrels daily.

Due to its proximity to the Guyana oil bounty, Trinidad and Tobago made a logical choice for Exxon. The supermajor had a presence in the Caribbean country until 2003, when it announced it would quit, following an unsuccessful exploration campaign.

Despite that failure, Trinidad and Tobago is the largest oil and gas producer in the Caribbean and the 17th largest in the world. Its oil and gas industry is seen growing at a compound annual rate of 4.4% over the decade to 2030, with companies involved in that growth including BP, Shell, and Spain’s Repsol—and now Exxon, which very much hopes to replicate its Guyana story in Trinidad.

The new exploration campaign will begin with an investment of $42 million and the drilling of two wells, the first of which could be drilled in six months, once the company finishes with its seismic survey of the area. If that is successful, development could be even faster than it was in Guyana, Reuters noted in a report on the news.

[TITLE]Danos Acquires Wood's Onshore Oil and Gas Labor Supply Operations in US:
[TEXT]
'We are actively seeking more acquisitions in the energy sector that increase our ability to service our customers and provide career development opportunities for our employees'.

Family-owned energy services provider Danos LLC has completed the acquisition of John Wood Group PLC’s onshore oil and gas labor supply operations in the United States.

Danos said in a media release that this is the seventh acquisition it has made since 2014.

“We are actively seeking more acquisitions in the energy sector that increase our ability to service our customers and provide career development opportunities for our employees”, Danos Ventures CEO Eric Danos said.

“We have been in the people business for 78 years”, Paul Danos, CEO of Danos, said. “Providing highly skilled personnel to build, maintain, and operate our customers’ assets safely is what we do”.

Danos said it has sustained a significant presence in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, and various other shale plays since 2012, providing a variety of production and renewable energy services.

Earlier Danos Operations Services secured a contract to provide production services for Beacon Offshore Energy’s new deepwater facility in the Gulf of America. The Shenandoah floating production system will employ production operators, instrumentation and electrical technicians, mechanics, and offshore installation managers. Several employees began work on the platform in 2024.

The Shenandoah facility is nearing completion of its hook-up and is anticipated to start oil production later this summer. Situated roughly 230 miles from New Orleans, the project has a designed capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil daily.

[TITLE]Centrica Signs 10 Year Deal for USA Natural Gas With Devon Energy:
[TEXT]
The deal expands Centrica's global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office.

Centrica Plc signed a 10-year agreement to buy natural gas from Devon Energy Corp. to help expand its activities across the Atlantic.

Centrica Energy, its trading arm, will receive 50,000 million British thermal units per day of natural gas from 2028, or the equivalent of five liquefied natural gas cargoes per year, according to a statement on Friday. The volumes will be indexed to TTF, the European benchmark price.

The deal expands Centrica’s global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office. The agreement will also help the firm to manage the price risk in its liquefied natural gas portfolio by aligning feed gas rates with European futures. For Devon, the deal offers exposure to international markets, according to the statement.

“Gas remains an essential transition fuel and, through long-term agreements like this, Centrica ensures competitively-indexed gas supply,” said Centrica Chief Executive Officer Chris O’Shea.

US natural gas producers are increasingly seeking to lock in agreements with buyers overseas. Both the Asian and the European benchmarks for the heating and power-generation fuel trade at roughly four times the price at Henry Hub in Louisiana, the US benchmark.

In February, Centrica signed a 15-year agreement to supply American LNG to Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and last year it struck a deal with US-based Coterra Energy Inc. to secure more gas.

The smell of yeast still hangs in the air at the Vivergo plant in Hull but the machines have fallen quiet.

More than 100 lorries usually pass through here each day, carrying 3,000 tonnes of wheat. It is milled, fermented and distilled. The final product is bioethanol, a renewable fuel that is then blended into E10 petrol.

This is a vast operation. It took several years to build, with considerable investment, but it is on the verge of closing down. Management and staff are holding out for a last-minute reprieve from the government but time is running out.

It's been a turbulent journey. The plant was already being annihilated by US rivals, losing
