US-based packaging company Georgia-Pacific has agreed to acquire Anchor Packaging, a manufacturer of rigid food containers and cling film.

Financial details of the acquisition have not been disclosed.

Headquartered in St Louis, Missouri, Anchor Packaging has operated as a portfolio company of private equity firm TJC (formerly known as The Jordan Company) since 2019. The packaging company has operations in the states of Arkansas and Wisconsin.

The move by Georgia-Pacific is anticipated to enhance its product offerings in the food service, retail and processor channels.

Based in the city of Atlanta, Georgia-Pacific operates the consumer brands Angel Soft, Brawny, Dixie, enMotion, Quilted Northern, Sparkle and Vanity Fair.

Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products Group executive vice-president David Duncan stated: “Anchor Packaging will be a significant addition to Georgia-Pacific’s consumer products platform with capabilities that will especially complement our Dixie business.

“Anchor’s talented teams are committed to understanding customer needs and delivering innovative and differentiated solutions to support the needs of the growing food-to-go market.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Anchor Packaging president and CEO Jeff Wolff stated: “This partnership allows us to expand our product portfolio, strengthen our supply chain and accelerate our commitment to innovation. We look forward to delivering even greater value to our customers and stakeholders.”

RBC Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs advised Anchor Packaging, while Nomura Securities International guided Georgia-Pacific in this transaction.

Dixie president Fernando González stated: “This is a major step in building a platform for growth.

“Adding Anchor Packaging to Georgia-Pacific’s portfolio aligns perfectly with our vision to be a preferred partner in providing innovative food and beverage packaging and tableware solutions to our customers. We are excited to welcome the Anchor Packaging team to Georgia-Pacific.”

In May 2025, Georgia-Pacific announced its plan to close its containerboard facility situated in Cedar Springs, Georgia, later in the year, citing concerns about the facility’s long-term competitiveness in meeting customer needs.

[TITLE]Penn State set to begin 'transformational' apparel deal with adidas:
[TEXT]
AI-assisted summary Penn State announced a 10-year partnership with adidas, ending its relationship with Nike.

The new deal will begin on July 1, 2026, and will outfit all 31 varsity sports programs.

Reports suggest the "transformational" agreement could be worth as much as $300 million.

Penn State is becoming an adidas school, after all.

University officials announced a "transformational" 10-year deal with adidas Friday as its official uniform, footwear and apparel partner − ending their more than three-decades relationship with Nike. The new deal begins July 1, 2026, the first day of Penn State's fiscal year.

Though Penn State did not release financial details, reports, like this one from the Centre Daily Times, say it could be worth as much as $300 million. Adidas will outfit each of Penn State's varsity athletic programs as well as produce merchandise for sale.

"Today, we step into a bold new era," is how Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft described the deal in a university news release.

"This partnership goes far beyond uniforms, it is unlike anything else in the marketplace. Adidas is making an unprecedented commitment to Penn State: delivering record investment in our department, groundbreaking NIL and marketing opportunities and access to technology and innovation that no other program can match.

Looking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.

"This agreement sets a new industry standard ..."

Penn State and adidas "will be prioritizing high-impact NIL agreements and brand marketing campaigns" for athletes in each of its 31 varsity sports, according to the release.

Earlier this summer, adidas continued its push deeper into the college apparel market by signing with the Tennessee Volunteers.

"We see this new agreement as a unique opportunity for us to help shape the next chapter of Penn State athletics while staying true to everything that makes the Nittany Lions an iconic brand," adidas president John Miller said in the release.

Of course, the impending apparel shift will be a dramatic change for many Penn State fans, who have been buying PSU Nike sports gear designs for more than 30 years.

It's also the latest in a growing line of significant athletic department moves since Kraft took over three years ago. They include hiring the first outside food vendor for PSU athletic venues (Oak View Group), replacing the university's media rights partner (PlayFly over Learfield) and starting an athletic department content subscription service (ROAR+).

Kraft, of course, also is overseeing the ongoing $700 million Beaver Stadium renovations.

Penn State agreed to a $50 million field-naming rights change − West Shore Home at Beaver Stadium − to help fund the project.

[TITLE]Ja'Marr Chase ditches Nike for Kevin Hart-led apparel brand: What to know about the Bengals WR's deal with Fabletics:
[TEXT]
Only a few days before the Cincinnati Bengals' season opener against the Cleveland Browns, one of their superstars made a major change.

On Thursday, it was announced that receiver Ja'Marr Chase is leaving Nike to sign with Fabletics, an apparel brand that has Kevin Hart as an investor and the face of its menswear line. According to Jordan Schultz, Chase becomes the first NFL star Fabletics has ever signed.

Sources: #Bengals superstar WR Ja'Marr Chase is making a bold move — leaving Nike to sign with Fabletics, the apparel brand Kevin Hart invested in.

One of the NFL's biggest stars teaming up with one of entertainment's biggest names, Chase will be the first NFL star Fabletics has… pic.twitter.com/FHDuPoRXrc — Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) September 4, 2025

In 2024, Chase won the NFL receiving "triple crown," leading the league in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. The 25-year-old had an incredible season with 127 receptions for 1,708 yards and seven touchdowns. He is only the sixth player in the Super Bowl era to accomplish this feat; Cooper Kupp was the last to do it in 2021, and before that, Steve Smith Sr. in 2005.

Chase is currently the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL, with an average annual salary of $40.25 million. The Bengals enter the season with high expectations, especially after giving him, Tee Higgins and Trey Hendrickson new contracts.

[TITLE]Olipop, Digitas and Front Office Sports are among the 2025 Digiday Awards winners:
[TEXT]
This year’s Digiday Awards winners reflect how brands are redefining consumer engagement through interactivity, cross-platform reach and data-driven personalization.

The chosen campaigns stood out for using emotional storytelling to build authentic connections and for creating experiences that sparked anticipation around product launches. Global cultural relevance also played a defining role, with brands tailoring their strategies to resonate across diverse markets.

Together these themes highlight a shift toward campaigns that are immersive, personal and universally resonant.

For instance, Ben Goodwin, co-founder and CEO of Olipop, has redefined soda by creating a functional alternative with low sugar and high fiber that supports digestive health — earning the award for Founder of the Year, a new category for 2025.

Under his leadership, the brand reached between $400 million and $450 million in revenue in 2024, achieved profitability, and secured a $1.85 billion valuation. Now sold in over 50,000 retail locations, Olipop has become the most widely adopted functional soda, with 25% adoption among Gen Z consumers and a presence in major arenas, convenience stores and cultural events nationwide.

Digitas secured the award for Best Collaboration for its efforts in joining forces with Flonase and Shondaland to tap into Bridgerton’s cultural moment and the fan obsession with #Polin. From the collaboration came a 90-second spot set in the show’s Regency-era world, where characters struggle with allergies but relief remains centuries away.

Dropped on social media ahead of the show’s season premiere, the ad was mistaken by some fans for a trailer. The campaign generated nearly 300 million impressions, boosted Flonase favorability and consideration by 29 points each, and proved a healthcare brand could spark genuine buzz in pop culture.

Front Office Sports partnered with Nuveen on Bobby Bonilla Day to spotlight the long-term value of financial planning through the lens of one of baseball’s most famous contracts. The strategy resulted in Front Office Sports winning this year’s award for Best Branding Campaign B2B.

By reframing Bonilla’s deferred deal as a lesson in guaranteed income, the campaign humanized retirement planning and connected with sports and business audiences alike. Distributed across YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram and X, the content delivered more than 19 million impressions and 124,000 engagements, while the hero video surpassed 10 million views, positioning Nuveen as a relatable voice on dependable financial solutions.

All in all, this year’s winners showcase the range of innovation driving brand storytelling and consumer connection, setting a new standard for how audiences connect with brands.

[TITLE]Subscription Box Market Forecast and Company Analysis Report 2025-2033 Featuring Blue Apron, FabFitFun, Glossybox, Grove Collaborative, Harry's, HelloFresh, Personalized Beauty Discovery, TechStyle:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Subscription Box Market - Consumer Trends & Forecast 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Global Subscription Box Market stood at US$ 30.16 billion in 2024 and is expected to be US$ 113.57 billion in 2033, growing at a CAGR of 14.18% during the forecast period 2025-2033. The growth is fuelled by growing consumer interest in customized products, convenience, and e-commerce growth. Beauty, food, fitness, and lifestyle categories continue to be popular among new subscribers across the world.

A subscription box is a monthly delivery service wherein customers get a specially curated package of products based on certain requirements or interests, normally delivered on a monthly basis. Such boxes come in a variety of categories like beauty, fashion, food, fitness, books, pet food, and many others. People subscribe to these services to find new products, indulge in tailor-made selection, or get necessities with no hassle of frequent shopping.

Across the globe, subscription boxes have become extremely popular because of their convenience and surprise aspect. They service niche markets and tend to support small or craft brands. E-commerce expansion, social media power, and shifting consumer attitudes have spurred international growth. Subscription services are mainstream in developed markets such as the U.S., U.K., and Australia, while developing markets like India and Brazil are quickly embracing. Businesses use them for customer retention, brand awareness, and data collection. As customization technology improves, subscription boxes enhance user experiences, fueling global appeal and market growth.

Growth Drivers in the Subscription Box Market

Rising Demand for Personalization and Convenience

Consumers increasingly seek personalized experiences tailored to their lifestyles, preferences, and needs. Subscription boxes fulfill this demand by offering curated selections across beauty, fashion, food, and wellness categories. The factor of convenience, where the goods are supplied at regular intervals without extra efforts, is also attractive to time-starved consumers.

Together, this aspect of customization and convenience increases the satisfaction and loyalty of the customers, fueling market growth. March 2023, Ipsy and BoxyCharm came together to form a combined beauty membership company. The combination brought together BoxyCharm's brand curation with Ipsy's AI-driven personalization, to drive customer experience for more than 20 million members.

E-Commerce and Digital Marketing Growth

The swift growth of e-commerce platforms and niche digital marketing initiatives complement the subscription box business model. Businesses utilize social media, influencer collaborations, and analytics to drive customer acquisition and retention. This online outreach simplifies access to niche customers, fueling subscriptions and global operations expansion.

Increased logistics and mobile app integration have further optimized consumer experience and retention. For example, in August 2022, as per a report released by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is a government agency in the US, the aggregate retail sales value of goods through online platforms in 2021 was $240.9 billion, which went up to $257.3 billion in 2022 the US.

Growth into Diversified Product Categories

Subscription boxes have been able to move into non-traditional areas such as fitness equipment, books, technology gadgets, pet products, and children's products with success. Diversification takes advantage of new customer bases and expands the total addressable size of the market. With continued innovation and diversified consumer interests, brands can develop new types of boxes to satisfy changing needs and maximize customer involvement.

For example, in July 2023, as per reports shared by Search Engine Journal, an American news publication firm, 4.8 billion social media users existed globally. In between 2022 and 2023, there was a 3.2% year-over-year growth, which led to 150 million new social media users. Hence, expanding social media is fueling the growth of the subscription box industry.

Challenges in the Subscription Box Market

High Customer Churn and Subscription Fatigue

Although sign-up rates may be high at first, holding onto subscribers in the long term proves to be a tough challenge. Subscribers often cancel after a few boxes of repetitiveness, no perceived value, or changed interests. Churn management needs ongoing innovation, high-quality products, and flexible pricing models. Subscription fatigue, when users feel overwhelmed by too many subscriptions, also forces companies to maintain strong differentiation.

Logistics, Supply Chain, and Cost Management

Effective logistics and inventory management are essential to ensuring deliveries on time and at a cost. Small brands might lack scale, particularly when there is a disruption in the supply chain, shipping volatility, or supply issues. Moreover, returns management, quality product management, and packaging cost can constrict profit margins and impact customer satisfaction if not managed well.

Replenishment Subscription Box Market

Replenishment boxes are designed for customers who require periodic delivery of must-haves like grooming products, home supplies, or dietary supplements. They thrive on necessity and predictability, ensuring stable demand and low customer churn. Brands here enjoy stable revenue streams and long-term relationships with customers. The model also ensures cost-effectiveness through bulk purchasing and subscription-based pricing benefits.

Curation Subscription Box Market

Subscription boxes with curated products of a specific theme or personal preference are usually found in beauty, fashion, book, or lifestyle categories. They sell on the basis of discovery and surprise, enabling customers to try new items that may not be chosen otherwise. The market relies heavily on aesthetics, customization, and value-added experience. Customer pleasure is generally tied to presentation and diversity in products.

Male Subscription Box Market

Men's subscription boxes have become popular, providing exclusive grooming products, fashion accessories, snacks, and fitness equipment. These boxes appeal to men wanting convenience and access to high-quality, niche products with no shopping ordeal. Increased male-targeted marketing, heightened self-care consciousness, and higher disposable income among younger males are driving the growth of this segment, especially in urban regions.

Food & Beverages Subscription Box Market

Food and drink boxes consist of meal kits, snacks, gourmet foods, and drinks such as coffee, wine, or tea. They bring convenience, variety, and the possibility to try new cuisines or dietary options. Consumers love health-aware options, dietary flexibility, and eco-friendliness. The segment has evolved quickly, particularly post-pandemic, as people have cooked more at home and sought experiential food options delivered right to their doorstep.

Pet Products Subscription Box Market

Pet subscription boxes provide treats, toys, grooming products, and accessories to individual pet types and sizes. Pet owners are more than happy to pay for the quality and convenience of their pets. These boxes tend to concentrate on fun and wellness, with customized pet elements. The sentiment between owners and pets underpins repeat purchase demand, which is a strong and expanding niche.

Fashion & Apparel Subscription Box Market

Fashion and apparel boxes offer personalized clothing and accessories according to size, fashion tastes, and season. Some plans include "try-before-you-buy" programs. This service attracts consumers who appreciate styling guidance and ease of use. AI-driven styling and access to personal stylists drive improved customer experiences. Sustainability-conscious fashion boxes are also emerging as popular options among environmentally aware customers looking for ethical and fashionable alternatives. For example, in February 2022, Kidpik, a US subscription-based e-commerce firm, launched a clothes subscription box service that sends custom outfits to the doorsteps of kids every month. It is the perfect choice for parents looking for a personalized, convenient, and fashion-forward means of shopping for their children's clothing, providing endless styles, high-quality fabrics, and a no-risk guarantee.

Kids & Baby Products Subscription Box Market

These boxes send toys, books, learning materials, apparel, or necessities for children and babies. Parents like suitable age customization, learning benefits, and ease. The market derives strength from deep emotional drivers and regular stages of growth in the life of kids, which encourages ongoing demand for fresh products. Safety, quality control, and developmental advantages play a key role in establishing trust and loyalty for this delicate segment.
