[TITLE]The World’s Chip Supply Chain Is Bracing for Fallout From China’s Rare-Earth Curbs:
[TEXT]
Businesses across the global semiconductor supply chain are bracing themselves for disruptions from an escalating trade war, after China imposed curbs on rare-earth mineral exports and the US responded with additional tariffs and restrictions on software sales to the Asian nation.

China’s restrictions, the most targeted move yet to limit supplies of rare-earth materials, represent the first major attempt by Beijing to exercise long-arm jurisdiction over foreign companies to target the semiconductor industry, threatening to stall the chips powering the AI boom. They prompted US President Donald Trump to announce on Friday that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on “any and all critical software.”

The rare-earth curbs may lead to weekslong delays in shipments for ASML Holding NV, the only manufacturer in the world of machines that make the most advanced semiconductors, a person familiar with the company said.

A senior manager at a major US chip company said the firm is still assessing potential impacts. But the clearest risk the company is facing now is an increase in the prices of rare earth-dependent magnets that are critical to the chip supply chain, this person said, asking not to be identified discussing operations.

An official at another US chip company said the business is rushing to identify which of its products contain rare earths from China and is worried that the country’s requirement for licenses will grind its supply chain to a halt.

It’s not clear what software products from the US might be hit by Trump’s latest proposed export ban. In July, the administration lifted export license requirements for chip-design software sales, rules that had been imposed in May as part of a raft of measures responding to Beijing’s earlier limits on shipments of essential rare earths.

China’s new rules require overseas firms to seek approval for shipping any material containing even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths — and explicitly call out parts used to make certain computer chips and advance AI research with military applications.

“These are the strictest export controls that China has utilized,” said Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals-focused director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s quite clear that they have the sticks and the leverage to make, not just US firms, but firms worldwide comply.”

Chipmaking machines, like those sold by ASML and Applied Materials Inc., are especially dependent on rare earths because they contain extremely precise lasers, magnets and other equipment that use these elements.

ASML is preparing for disruptions, particularly due to a clause that requires foreign firms to seek China’s approval for reexports of products containing its rare earths, said the person familiar with ASML, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters and noted that ASML is lobbying Dutch and US allies for alternatives. The company declined to comment.

“Within the semiconductor value chain, China’s new export controls will likely most impact chipmakers that use rare-earth-based chemicals during the chip fabrication process and toolmakers that integrate rare-earth magnets into their equipment,” said Jacob Feldgoise, senior data research analyst at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

Some have questioned how long the restrictions will last, viewing them as potential posturing ahead of a trip to Asia Trump had planned that was expected to include a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. It’s unclear how China would even track rare earths at such discrete levels to enforce the rules.

But China’s move has instead escalated tensions with the US. Trump’s announced tariffs would raise import taxes on many Chinese goods to 130% starting next month. That would be just below the 145% level imposed earlier this year, before both countries ratcheted down the levies in a truce to advance trade talks. On Friday, Trump also threatened to call off his meeting with Xi altogether, describing the new rare-earth controls as a “hostile” action.

“I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

This isn’t the first time that rare earths have landed in the center of US-China trade wars. After Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese imports earlier this year, China’s government responded by cutting off mineral exports to US companies. Officials from both sides had agreed to a truce in the spring, under which Trump lowered duties and Xi’s officials agreed to resume the flow of the minerals.

The world’s biggest chipmakers, including Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., rely on ASML to produce semiconductors. Samsung and Intel declined to comment. TSMC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A White House official said the government and relevant agencies are assessing any impact from the new rules, which were announced without notice and imposed in an apparent effort to exert control over the entire world’s technology supply chains.

The US House Select Committee on China panned the Asian nation for the move, describing the restrictions as “an economic declaration of war against the US.” Committee Chairman John Moolenaar, a Republican, said in a statement on Thursday that China has “fired a loaded gun at the American economy.”

Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, has already introduced measures to diversify its supply of raw materials, and its economic ministry called China’s curbs a “great concern” on Friday. The government said it’s in close contact with affected companies and the European Commission to respond.

Taiwan relies mainly on Europe, the US and Japan for rare-earth supplies. “We still need further assessment before deciding on the impact” on the chip industry, the nation’s economic affairs ministry said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor indirect impact from fluctuations in the pricing of raw materials and supply chain adjustments.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping ’s blistering response to Donald Trump violating the terms of their fragile trade truce has reignited a tit-for-tat spiral, exposing the rocky path to any US-China trade deal.After China unveiled wide-ranging global export controls on products containing even traces of certain rare earths this past week, Trump fired back by threatening to cancel a planned in-person meeting with Xi — their first in six years. The US leader also announced plans to double tariffs on Chinese goods to 100%, along with sweeping curbs on “any and all critical software.”On Sunday, Beijing justified its moves as defensive actions and accused the US of introducing new restrictive measures targeting China since talks between the two in Madrid in September. Last month, the US Commerce Department unveiled a dramatic expansion of its export controls, which closed loopholes in current measures to block Beijing from cutting-edge chips.“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” the Commerce Ministry said. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it.”China’s backlash shows Beijing viewed a tariff truce stuck during Geneva talks in May — and reinforced a month later in London — as hinging on an agreement both sides would freeze any new curbs on critical shipments. The latest rupture demonstrates Xi is drawing red lines on such curbs, setting up Beijing now either to retaliate on tariffs or engage in damage control with the US to regain an equilibrium where trade can flow.“We will not be intimidated by such coercive and unilateral actions of power politics,” said Zhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under the Ministry of Commerce. “Our actions have clearly shown this.”Both sides have left room for deescalation. Trump’s tariffs are slated for Nov. 1, days after the expected meeting with Xi at a summit in South Korea. China’s new controls are set to begin taking effect a week later, shortly before the latest trade truce holding back tariffs as high as 145% expires.Export controls on technology and magnets critical to artificial intelligence and weapons manufacturing are at the heart of trade negotiations between the world’s biggest economies.After Trump hit China with 145% tariffs in April, Xi blocked US firms from buying its magnets, sparking factory closures and panic over the nation’s dependence on Beijing for metals vital to national security. If the US leader hikes tariffs again, Beijing could reimpose that blockade bringing both sides back to a battle of which superpower can withstand more economic pain.Washington’s fear of China is strategic, not economic,” according to analysts at Hutong Research, an independent analysis firm. “A disruption in rare earth flows threatens defense production capacity, a core pillar of US global power projection and, by extension, dollar stability.”The latest showdown underscores the difficulty for two rivals to strike a trade deal. Chinese negotiators have reportedly dangled a huge investment package to Trump’s team, but such capital flows would likely be blocked by US national security controls. The fallout could also jeopardize a deal for China-owned social media giant TikTok ’s US operations, which US lawmakers have previously opposed over security concerns.Ultimately, the US will find the escalation and any collapse of the TikTok deal harder to bear than its rival, according to CF40, a Beijing-based economic think tank, which said China could hedge against higher US tariffs with policy support.“The Trump administration relies on TikTok to woo young voters, and with political pressure from the 2026 mid-term elections it has limited scope for extreme measures,” the organization wrote in a Saturday paper. “Inflation and shortages that tariffs are causing in the US will be hard to alleviate in the short term.”Chinese exports have hit new records in many markets this year, showing Beijing can survive without the US consumer. Data due Monday is expected to show the factory engine surging ahead again, giving Xi more breathing room. Still, a huge spike in tariffs would put more pressure on an economy already battling weak domestic demand and deflationary pressures.Officials from both sides could sit down again as soon as this week, when a team from China heads to Washington for a regular round of meetings with international finance chiefs. Officials from Beijing could face pushback there from global counterparts, as its latest rare earths curbs are not limited to the US, threatening to also disrupt European and Asian firms.The renewed brinkmanship revives fears of a deeper rupture in global trade that could push the two economies toward partial decoupling. Markets recoiled on Friday, with US stocks suffering their worst selloff in six months, and commodities from soybeans to wheat, copper and cotton all falling.Ultimately, the endgame will likely involve some form of negotiated settlement, said Ray Wang, lead semiconductor analyst at The Futurum Group. “The economic, security and supply-chain stakes for both sides are simply too high to sustain the current standoff indefinitely,” he added.Earlier this year, China used its dominance of vital rare earths to help force Trump into easing export controls on certain goods to the Asian nation. Xi’s team could push the US for a similar climb down in their next round of talks.Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of state-run tabloid Global Times, described the rupture in recent days as a “turning point” in China’s relationship with the US, as it wields its leverage in rare earths to hold back chip curbs.“This year, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese products several times without even consulting us. Sanctioning our companies was done just as casually,” he wrote on X. “China will use its strength to prevent the US from crossing the line.”

[TITLE]Turkey Emerges as a Regional Leader in Renewable Energy Expansion:
[TEXT]
Turkey has invested heavily in its renewable energy sector in recent years, and the country’s green energy capacity has increased faster than anticipated, which has strengthened its energy security and helped it rely less on energy imports. The government has invested heavily in diversifying the energy mix since the early 2000s, far ahead of several other countries in the region. It aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2053, with a strong focus on establishing energy independence to reduce reliance on other countries for its energy.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Turkey has introduced energy policies aimed at modernisation, liberalisation, and increased domestic production capacity, as it has sought to diversify its energy mix over the last decade. The country’s renewable electricity generation has tripled in the last 10 years, and the government is currently pursuing Turkey’s first nuclear power facility.

In January, the think tank Ember Energy reported that Turkey’s solar energy capacity had doubled in the previous two and a half years to exceed the government’s 2025 target. New installations for self-consumption have driven 94 percent of the growth since July 2022, increasing from 9.7 GW to over 19 GW by the end of 2024. Solar power now contributes roughly 6 percent of Turkey’s total electricity supply.

The accelerated deployment of solar capacity has helped save significant spending on imports. According to Ember, between July 2022 and December 2024, the combined solar and wind energy output helped prevent $15 billion in natural gas imports and helped to boost the country’s energy independence, as well as reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Turkey’s project pipeline of 33 GW in pre-licensed storage-integrated solar and wind projects, far exceeds the government’s 2030 target of 2.1 GW, showing great promise for sustained sectoral growth. The think tank suggests that Turkey could use rooftop, hybrid, floating and storage-integrated solar potential to continue with its solar power momentum.

By the end of August, Turkey’s installed renewable energy capacity climbed to 74 GW, with electricity generation from domestic resources reached 85 GW, according to data from the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry. The country’s total installed electricity capacity was almost 120.8 GW, with hydropower plants dominating the energy mix and contributing almost 27 percent of the total. Natural gas contributes around 25 GW, or 25 percent of the total, while solar power contributed 24 GW, wind capacity stood at almost 14 GW and domestic coal provided for 11 GW. Turkey continues to import over 10 GW of coal, 2.3 GW of electricity from biomass and 1.7 GW from geothermal plants.

Related: OPEC+ Nears Its Limit, Leaving Prices One Crisis Away from a Spike

Current projections suggest that Turkey could meet its additional electricity capacity needs through the development of 8 GW of hybrid solar power projects integrated into existing hydropower and wind power plants. The National Energy Plan forecasts that Turkey’s electricity demand will reach 455 terawatt-hours in 2030 and 510 terawatt-hours in 2035. The growth is expected to require an additional 17 GW of capacity by 2030 and 27 GW by 2035.

Turkey’s wind energy sector is gradually expanding, with around $1.3 billion in investment in the industry last year, supporting 1.3 GW of wind power installations. The Turkish Wind Energy Association expects this figure to increase to $1.5 billion in 2025 with 1.5 GW of new capacity. This follows the inauguration of several new wind farms in May, which have spurred greater investor interest in the market.

In the coming years, Turkey is expected to develop its hydrogen and electric vehicle (EV) markets as it builds upon its energy diversification success. The EU recently announced a $3.22 million technical assistance project to help Turkey accelerate the development of its green and low-carbon sector in collaboration with state energy firm BOTAS (Turkish Petroleum Pipeline Corporation). The programme “Boosting Green and Low-Carbon Hydrogen in Türkiye” is aimed at reinforcing institutional capabilities and expanding sector-wide expertise across the country.

Turkey’s EV industry has grown significantly this year to overtake Belgium as the fourth-largest selling passenger battery electric vehicle (BEV) market in Europe. EV sales in Turkey more than tripled in June, to 25,646 units, up from only 8,032 units in June 2024, according to Turkey’s Automotive Distributors’ and Mobility Association. The market has expanded rapidly in recent years, largely thanks to the government’s special consumption tax. ÖTV. The special tax rates were rolled out alongside the launch of local BEV startup Togg’s first car, the T10X crossover, in 2023, and have also encouraged other EV makers to enter the market. For example, in July 2024, China's biggest EV maker, BYD, signed a $1 billion deal to establish a manufacturing plant in Turkey.

Turkey’s renewable energy market is going from strength to strength thanks to favourable government policies, support from Europe, and higher levels of private investment. As it continues to expand its solar and wind energy sectors, it will also focus on developing its low-carbon hydrogen industry and encouraging the production and uptake of EVs across the country.

[TITLE]White House says substantial US government job cuts have begun due to shutdown:
[TEXT]
By Ahmed Aboulenein, Andy Sullivan, Nathan Layne and Courtney Rozen

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House said on Friday that it had begun substantial layoffs across the U.S. government, as President Donald Trump followed through on a threat to cut the federal workforce during the government shutdown.

Job cuts were under way at the Treasury Department, the U.S. health agency and the departments of education, commerce, and Homeland Security's cybersecurity division, spokespeople said, but the total extent of the layoffs was not immediately clear. Roughly 300,000 federal civilian workers had already been set to leave their jobs this year due to a downsizing campaign initiated earlier this year by Trump.

"The RIFs have begun," White House budget director Russell Vought wrote on social media, referring to so-called reductions in force. A spokesperson for the budget office characterized the cuts as "substantial," without offering further details.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire federal workers during the shutdown standoff, in its 10th day on Friday, and has suggested his administration will aim primarily at parts of the government championed by Democrats.

He has ordered the freezing of at least $28 billion in infrastructure funds for New York, California and Illinois - all home to sizable populations of Democratic voters and critics of the administration.

DEMOCRATIC VOTES NEEDED TO END SHUTDOWN

Trump's Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of Congress, but need at least seven Democratic votes to pass a funding bill in the Senate, where Democrats are holding out for an extension of health-insurance subsidies.

Democrats said they will not cave to Trump's pressure tactics.

"Until Republicans get serious, they own this - every job lost, every family hurt, every service gutted is because of their decisions," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.

Labor unions representing federal workers have sued to stop the layoffs, saying they would be illegal during a shutdown.

The administration said in a Friday court filing that the unions' request should be denied because they lack the legal right to sue over federal personnel decisions.

A federal judge is due to hear the case on October 16.

The government is required by law to give workers 60 days' notice ahead of any layoffs, though that can be shortened to 30 days.

TARGETING FURLOUGHED WORKERS

The announcement of the layoffs came on the same day that many federal workers were due to get reduced paychecks that do not include any pay for the days since the shutdown began. Hundreds of thousands have been ordered not to report to work, while others have been ordered to keep working without pay. The nation's 2 million active-duty troops will miss their October 15 paycheck entirely if the shutdown is not resolved before then.

Employees across multiple divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services have received layoff notices, communications director Andrew Nixon said. The 78,000 workers at the sprawling agency monitor disease outbreaks, fund medical research, and perform a wide range of other health-related duties.

Nixon said the layoffs were targeted at agency staff who have been ordered not to work, but did not provide further details. Roughly 41% of agency staff have been furloughed, including three out of four workers at the National Institutes of Health and two out of three employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to government shutdown plans.

The layoffs do not include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees several major public insurance programs, according to an employee familiar with the matter.

Layoffs have also begun at the Treasury Department, according to a spokesperson who requested anonymity.

A labor union official, Thomas Huddleston of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a court filing he had been told Treasury was preparing 1,300 layoff notices. Those layoffs could hit the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, which has been targeted for steep job cuts this year. Some 46% of the agency's 78,000 employees were furloughed on Wednesday.

Officials also confirmed job cuts at the Education Department, which Trump has vowed to shutter completely, and the Commerce Department, which handles weather forecasting, economic data reports, and other tasks.

Other media outlets reported layoffs at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Department of Interior, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Spokespeople at those agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security said layoffs were taking place at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which incurred Trump's wrath after the 2020 election when its director said there was no evidence voting systems were compromised. Trump falsely claims that he lost that election to Democrat Joe Biden due to voter fraud.

"This is part of getting CISA back on mission," DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

The Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration are not affected, according to a source familiar with the situation.

[TITLE]The Trump Administration Begins 'Substantial' Layoffs of Federal Workers:
[TEXT]

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought speaks as U.S. President Donald Trump listens in the Oval Office. (Sipa USA/Newscom)

It's day 10 of the government shutdown, and the Trump administration is finally starting to make good on its plans to permanently lay off federal workers.

"RIFs have begun," Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought wrote in a X post on Friday, using the acronym for "reductions for force"—the technical jargon for government layoffs.

The RIFs have begun. — Russ Vought (@russvought) October 10, 2025

The administration has offered no details on the layoffs, beyond the OMB's comment to Semafor that they will be "substantial."

Any permanent firings of government workers during a shutdown would also be unusual. Typically, federal workers are temporarily furloughed when Congress fails to agree on appropriations bills to keep the government open, and then given back pay once funding resumes.

In September, as Politico first reported, Vought circulated a memo to government agencies instructing them to prepare more permanent "reduction in force" plans should a shutdown occur.

In the event of a shutdown, agencies were told to eliminate employees working on "programs, projects, or activities" whose funding had lapsed during the shutdown, and which were not "consistent with the President's priorities."

Once funding resumes, Vought's memo instructed agencies to "revise their RIFs as needed to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions."

In short, the Trump administration is hoping to use the shutdown to permanently reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy, with an immediate focus on eliminating employees who might be working on programs that conflict with President Donald Trump's agenda.

This is just the latest example of the Trump White House arm-twisting Democrats during the shutdown. Last week, federal departments announced they'd be pausing the release of funds for transportation and energy projects in Democratic states.

Whether the president has the legal power to unilaterally fire employees en masse during the shutdown is controversial.

Vought asserted in his RIF memo that since funding has lapsed for discretionary programs, there's no statutory requirement that they be carried out. Staff dedicated to those programs can therefore be let go at the executive branch's discretion.

In a lawsuit filed at the beginning of the shutdown, the major public sector unions rejected this argument. They asserted that a temporary lapse in funding for a program does not mean the legal authorization for the program has lapsed.

Additionally, they argued that since federal law prohibits the executive branch from devoting resources to activities for which there's no funding, the Trump administration can't devote resources to firing employees during the shutdown.

In short, this is yet another battle in the constant war Trump and Vought have been fighting with government employees, their union representatives, and liberal litigants more generally, over the extent of the president's power over executive branch employees.

Vought has consistently asserted that the president has effectively unlimited authority to hire and fire at will. Laws to the contrary are unconstitutional and can more or less be ignored.

His critics argue that Congress has substantial power to shape and regulate the federal bureaucracy, including on matters of personnel, and that creates significant legal limits on the president's personnel decisions.

Government unions are already preparing to challenge the shutdown layoffs. The AFL-CIO, which already sued over Vought's initial memo, intimated on X that they'd sue to challenge the actual layoffs as well.

America's unions will see you in court. https://t.co/mowwgTvzKZ — AFL-CIO ✊ (@AFLCIO) October 10, 2025

Reducing federal headcount has been one of the few areas where the Trump administration's government-slashing efforts have produced significant results.

Trump took over a federal bureaucracy numbering some 2.4 million civilian federal employees in January. Between firings, retirements, and the administration's deferred resignation program, it's estimated that there are 201,000 fewer federal workers as of September 23.

The layoffs Vought announced Friday would be in addition to that figure.

The Trump administration has said it plans to end the year down some 300,000 employees, which would amount to a 12 percent cut in the federal workforce. Depending on how many workers are let go during the shutdown and whether their firings are allowed to stand, the federal workforce could end up being even smaller still come 2026.

That'd be much to the good. The federal government does too many things. By definition, it employs too many people as well.

A smaller federal workforce equates to a smaller government. Workers who leave non-productive federal employment for productive private sector work enrich the entire economy.

To be sure, there's only so much firing federal workers can achieve in the pursuit of a leaner state. Reducing federal headcount doesn't by itself eliminate federal laws, regulations, or programs.

It also has a relatively marginal impact on the cost of government, given that the vast majority of government spending is not going toward civil servants' pay and benefits.

Still, most shutdowns end with no real change to the size or scope of the federal government. Eventually, appropriations are passed, spending resumes, and government employees go back to work.

This time, if the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs are allowed to stand, the government that reopens will be smaller than the one that closed down.

[TITLE]Kevin O’Leary says the best time to start a business is during chaos:
[TEXT]
Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary acknowledged that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are a headache and increase input costs, but said entrepreneurs have not only survived in similar environments but also thrived.

In a wide-ranging interview with Politico on Monday, he said entrepreneurs have endured trade wars, periods of sky-high interest rates, and a real-estate meltdown.

“In fact, the best time to start a business, proven by the statistics, is in chaos,” O’Leary added. “Every time the American economy is going through some kind of a correction is a fantastic time to be an entrepreneur and start something. And then you have to figure out how to pivot through it.”

According to the Census Bureau, business formations soared during the pandemic after falling in the immediate aftermath of lockdown and have been volatile since then, with several big spikes and sharp dives.

In August, the number of business applications rose 0.5% from the prior month, continuing an uptrend that began earlier this year despite a brief retreat that coincided with Trump’s tariff rollout, which triggered chaos in financial markets as duties headed for the highest levels in nearly a century.

However, most of the recent gains have been concentrated in retail trade, while construction, administrative support, professional services, as well as transportation and warehousing, have been flat.

O’Leary added that the advent of AI has boosted productivity and contributed to the stock market hitting record highs.

“Every single one of my companies uses it today, and it’s very productive. It helps enhance margins. It reduces costs in every sector of the economy,” he explained.

For example, homebuilders are using AI to help allocate capital expenditures and labor. And while large companies like automakers are getting hit with higher costs, O’Leary said trade deals are getting worked out.

Deals with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, for example, have lowered auto tariffs to 15% from 25%, while also committing them to hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. investments.

In such an environment, the key is to look past the politics and focus on the policies “so you can make radical investment decisions at minimal risk,” O’Leary argued.

“If you look for the path of least resistance, you want to find big opportunities because of disruption,” he explained. “You want to find something that has completely been dislocated and invest in that because of the policy changes.”

Meanwhile, O’Leary also cautioned the Trump administration against its deal with Intel, interfering with the Federal Reserve’s independence, and the spillover effects of its H-1B visa policy on startups, which will have a harder time paying the proposed $100,000 fee than large companies.

O’Leary pointed out there’s highly specialized talent that can’t all be filled with domestic workers. And startups that hire AI engineers from abroad, for instance, gain a competitive advantage amid the global talent race.

“I don’t think we want to take that away from American companies,” he said. “So I would adjust this H-1B mandate for only large corporations at some size where they can afford it.”

[TITLE]Rotterdam Port Lashers to Suspend Strike from Monday:
[TEXT]
IMF: Saudi Support Bolsters Yemen’s Economic Stability

Prime Minister Salem Bin Braik during his meeting with the Saudi Ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jaber, following the announcement of Saudi support for Yemen (Asharq Al-Awsat)

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revealed that the latest Saudi financial package of $368 million to support Yemen’s budget and the energy and health sectors has helped stabilize the country’s macroeconomy.

According to a recent IMF report, Saudi financial support to Yemen, which totaled nearly $2 billion in 2023-2024, played a critical role in mitigating economic collapse. The Yemeni government was able to reduce its budget deficit to 1.9% of GDP in 2024.

After an eleven-year hiatus, the IMF announced the resumption of Article IV consultations with Yemen, describing the move as a “positive indicator” of renewed institutional engagement and more accurate economic data, despite ongoing conflict and its severe impact on both the economy and the population.

Yemeni Prime Minister Salem Bin Braik hailed the renewed dialogue with the IMF as a “pivotal moment in restoring Yemen’s presence within international financial institutions,” reflecting the government’s commitment to financial and administrative reforms despite numerous challenges.

The IMF report underscored that Yemen has endured one of the world’s worst humanitarian and economic crises since the conflict began in 2014. Real GDP contracted by approximately 27% over the past decade, while per capita income fell sharply. Inflation and currency devaluation have eroded household purchasing power.

The report noted that following the suspension of oil exports due to Houthi attacks on oil facilities in 2022, Yemen became a net oil importer for the first time in decades.

Today, more than half of the population requires urgent humanitarian aid, as the economy suffers from structural weaknesses, widespread food insecurity, and mass displacement.

Government revenues fell from 22.5% of GDP in 2014 to below 12% in 2024, with public debt exceeding 100% of GDP in government-controlled areas. The current account deficit widened to about 11% in 2024, and foreign exchange reserves dropped to less than one month of imports.

The IMF stressed that Saudi financial support, totaling roughly $2 billion in 2023-2024, helped curb further deterioration, allowing the government to reduce the budget deficit to 1.9% of GDP in 2024.

The IMF forecast a slight contraction of 0.5% in 2025, followed by gradual recovery starting in 2026 with 0.5% growth, reaching 2.5% by 2030. Recovery is expected to be driven by rising non-oil exports, remittances, and ongoing agricultural and development projects. Inflation is projected to ease as the exchange rate stabilizes and global food supplies improve.

The IMF further warned that ongoing political instability and renewed conflict could undermine reforms and delay economic recovery. External financial support remains crucial to maintain public services and prevent humanitarian deterioration.

The September 2025 Saudi package, alongside contributions from the UAE, represented a “positive step” toward macroeconomic stability.

The report emphasized that achieving fiscal balance will require unified tax and customs revenues, rationalized public spending and improved financial transparency.

[TITLE]EQT scraps Zelestra India sale, brings in O2's Parag Sharma to lead $600 mn push:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: European alternative asset manager EQT has dropped the plan to sell renewable developer Zelestra’s India operations and instead transferred it to its Asia Pacific infrastructure team headed by Hong Kong-based partner Ken Wong.

EQT will also invest around $600 million to develop the portfolio and has brought in Parag Sharma, former chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of EQT—and Temasek-backed O2 Power, to head the company, replacing incumbent CEO Sajay K.V., said four people aware of the development.

Zelestra had hired JP Morgan to run the sale process for its India operations, eyeing a deal with an equity and enterprise value of $184 million and $421 million, respectively. Mint earlier reported that the world’s largest alternative asset manager Blackstone was looking to acquire Zelestra’s Indian operations.

The new plan is to carve out Zelestra India as a separate company and build it on similar lines as O2 Power, which was sold to JSW Neo Energy in December last year for an enterprise value of $1.47 billion.

“EQT is not selling Zelestra India now. The plan is to build another O2 Power. While the sale process run by JP Morgan was on, it was decided that EQT’s Asia Pacific team would take Zelestra India forward on similar lines as was done for O2 Power," said one of the four people cited above, requesting anonymity. “It will still be housed under the EQT Infrastructure V fund, but placed under a different partner. The plan is to infuse another $600 million in expanding Zelestra India portfolio."

The second person cited above, who also did not want to be named, said, “EQT Asia infrastructure team is carving out Zelestra India operations out of Zelestra and will run it as a portfolio company."

Sharma, who has already joined Zelestra India as its new CEO, declined to comment. Sajay K.V. did not respond to phone calls or a message left on his cellphone.

Spokespersons for EQT, Zelestra, JP Morgan and Blackstone declined to comment.

Zelestra India has an operational capacity of 600 megawatt (MW), with an additional 2 gigawatt (GW) contracted portfolio, of which 1.5GW is under construction. The green energy platform is targeting 8.6GW capacity by 2031.

Sajay K.V. had taken over as the CEO of Zelestra’s Indian business unit in December 2023, after stints with BrightNight Power, Hero Future Energies, Siemens Gamesa and Vestas.

EQT has €273 billion in assets under management. Zelestra has a 29GW of global portfolio in 13 countries and has been present in India since 2015.

India’s green energy capacity addition has been on an upward trajectory. With a solar power sector potential of 748GW, India has an installed renewable energy capacity of 245GW, of which solar and wind power account for 116GW and 52GW, respectively. The country plans to add 50GW of green energy capacity annually to reach 500GW by 2030. Given the nation’s green energy transition trajectory and the net-zero target by 2070, the plan is to add 1,800GW of renewable energy capacity by 2047 and 5,000GW by 2070.

Also Read | Global energy firm Zelestra looks to sell India business for $400-500 million

This large scale of India’s green energy space has opened up mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities and attracted global and domestic investor interest.

“The power sector led M&A activity worth US$8.5 billion, driven largely by the renewable energy sector's growth," wrote EY in a 13 August report.

“The renewable energy sector in India alone contributed around 80% of the power sector’s total, marking a significant increase from US$3.2 billion in H1 2024 and US$2.8 billion in H2 2024, indicating a strong interest in sustainable investments," the EY report said.

“India is now recognized as the world’s fourth-largest renewable energy market, having attracted over US$4 billion in FDI in the past year alone… The presence of over 60 marquee global investors, a strong track record of profitable exits and a progressive policy framework are accelerating the shift towards the next level of growth in renewable energy," the report said.

[TITLE]Canada doesn’t like immigration anymore. This is a problem:

Kevin Yin is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail and an economics doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley.

Support for immigration in Canada has cratered. Ottawa started polling Canadians in 1996 on their views on immigration. According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, last year was the first time that a majority of Canadians believed there were too many immigrants. A more recent Nanos poll finds that 71 per cent now favour reducing their number. If the government cannot win back support for one of Canada’s flagship policies, our long-term economic growth and geopolitical influence are at risk.

Let me begin by acknowledging that record levels of immigration after the pandemic did exacerbate an already-serious housing crisis and that Canadians are justifiably concerned

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]
Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defence, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world’s lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60-70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union — long-term trading partners with African nations — have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa’s resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa’s position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasise local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa’s critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another “resource curse.”

The emerging ‘New World Order’

A Chinese-led ‘New World Order’ is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organisations. The initiative has expanded China’s access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent

New Delhi: India should consider making rules easier for foreign companies to fully own local units in the defence sector, said Patrice Caine, chief executive of French military, avionics and cybersecurity software group Thales “Countries like France, Australia and the UK — they make a clear distinction between protecting intellectual property and economic rights. They don’t care who owns the company as long as the intellectual property is protected by them,” he told ET in an interview. “Perhaps this will evolve in India.”India allows 100% foreign investment in the defence sector. While investment up to 74% in a joint venture with a local company requires no prior government approval under the automatic route, the process for a foreign investor to hold a stake beyond that is complex and requires multiple government clearances.The government has been extremely cautious on allowing full ownership for foreign companies in this strategic sector. Sweden’s Saab is probably the only foreign company that has so far received New Delhi’s approval for a fully owned local subsidiary, to make anti-tank weapons under an estimated `500-crore project.Meanwhile, Indian conglomerates have entered the sector in partnerships with foreign companies, including Thales.These companies include Reliance Industries Adani Group and Mahindra , as the government pushes for boosting local participation in defence supplies for the Indian armed forces as well as for exports.Caine, who was in India on a short visit, sought to dispel concerns

[TITLE]Italy to Acquire Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft and Drones in New Defense Plan:
[TEXT]
The 2025–2027 Defense Planning Document confirms Italy’s ambitious modernization, introducing new acquisitions while consolidating major programs.

The Italian Ministry of Defense has released the 2025–2027 Documento Programmatico Pluriennale (DPP), the annual multi-year planning document that outlines national defense investments and modernization priorities. The new edition details how Italy intends to enhance readiness, upgrade existing fleets, and invest in future technologies across all branches of the Armed Forces, reaching the NATO target of 2% of the GDP.

The DPP builds on the momentum of recent years, reaffirming long-term programs such as the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), Eurofighter Typhoon, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the renovation of the armored forces, while introducing new initiatives.

Among these is the acquisition of six unspecified Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft (M3A). This is a critical step toward restoring Italy’s long-range anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability lost with the retirement of the Breguet Atlantic in 2017 and the replacement with the P-72.

Additionally, new investments are being made for unmanned platforms. Notably, one of these programs involves the procurement of new armed drones for the Italian Air Force in the very short term.

Strategic and Geopolitical Context

As in previous editions, the DPP frames its defense planning within the concept of the “Extended Mediterranean” region, encompassing Europe’s southern flank, North Africa, the Sahel, and the Middle East. This area continues to be described as the epicenter of instability, influenced by the events in Ukraine, Gaza, and the Red Sea, with potential spillover effects on European and global security.

The document emphasizes that the war in Ukraine remains a turning point for European defense policy, reaffirming the need for readiness, ammunition stocks, and deterrence capabilities. The Middle East, with Iran’s growing involvement and attacks on maritime routes by Houthi forces, is cited as a direct challenge to global stability and energy security.

The MoD also points to the increasing relevance of the Indo-Pacific and the Arctic, which is reshaping the Euro-Atlantic security architecture. This is also expanding Italy’s strategic horizon, thus requiring new maritime and air capabilities for long-range surveillance and deterrence.

For Italy, the “Expanded Mediterranean” still remains a strategic priority, together with the need to be ready to operate across multiple domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyber.

Evolution of the Italian Military

The second section of the DPP details the transformation of the Italian Armed Forces to respond to the current strategic and geopolitical context and ensure readiness, technological superiority, and interoperability within allied frameworks. The overarching goal is a modern, balanced, and sustainable force structure, capable of responding to both high-intensity conflicts and hybrid threats.

Among the key capability development areas are:

Joint/Interforce domain: Strengthening command, control, communications, and cyber defense (C2/C4ISR); developing multi-domain operational capabilities.

Land domain: Renewal of heavy, medium, and light combat vehicles; expanded use of drones at all echelons; modernization of artillery, logistics, and air-defense systems.

Naval domain: Modernization of front-line units and submarines, enhancement of anti-submarine and anti-drone warfare capabilities, and integration of unmanned maritime systems.

Aerospace domain: Renewal of aircraft fleets (including combat, transport, and rotorcraft); development of sixth-generation aircraft under the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP); reinforcement of missile defense and space-based surveillance.

Space and cyber domains: Expansion of Earth observation and secure communication satellite constellations; independent access to space; improved cyber resilience across defense networks.

Weapons and munitions: Replenishment of national stockpiles, reflecting lessons from the Ukraine conflict.

Let’s now dissect the plans for each service.

Army Programs

The Italian Army continues the modernization process initiated in recent years, focusing on mobility, protection, and deep-strike capabilities. Among the main initiatives are the new Main Battle Tank and Army Armoured Combat System (A2CS), whose development continues with new €2 billion funding for a new generation of tanks and vehicles to replace aging platforms, integrating multi-domain connectivity.

Artillery and long-range fires are also being looked at, as Italy is progressing with the acquisition of 21 M142 HIMARS launchers and the upgrade of the M270 MLRS to the A2 standard. These will be complemented by new 155 mm systems and loitering munitions for stand-off precision strike.

Air defenses will see an expansion of short- and medium-range systems, including additional Grifo SHORAD (short range air defense) units equipped with CAMM-ER (Common Antiair Modular Missile – Extended Range) and six new SAMP/T New Generation (NG) batteries.

The Army plans to acquire micro, mini, and light drones for ISR and support missions, including both fixed- and rotary-wing systems with high endurance and short, medium and long range. This is part of the larger plan to equip all echelons with unmanned assets to increase capabilities also in contested scenarios.

For the Army Aviation, the DPP includes continued support for NH-90, CH-47, and AH-129 fleets, alongside the ongoing development of the AH-249A NEES (New Exploration and Escort Helicopter). With the latest planning, Italy’s next-generation attack and reconnaissance helicopter received an additional € 1.35 billion funding.

Navy Programs

The Italian Navy will also see notable developments, particularly in its aviation and surface combatant components. One of the most significant new entries in the DPP is the acquisition of six Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft (M3A), a joint program between the Air Force and Navy that will restore Italy’s long-range Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capability.

This capability was lost with the retirement of the Breguet Atlantic in 2017. The new platform will complement the existing P-72A fleet, extending Italy’s maritime patrol coverage and providing a higher-end capability for undersea warfare and surveillance. Reports mention the Kawasaki P-1 is a favorite candidate.

For the surface fleet, construction continues on two new generation FREMM EVO frigates, new patrol and mine-countermeasure vessels, and logistics platforms. These will replace older vessels, including some that have been sold, and strengthen blue-water capabilities.

As mentioned in last year’s DPP, the Navy will receive five additional F-35B jets for the naval aviation as part of the new 25-aircraft order. This will bring the service’s fleet to 20 STOVL aircraft, which will be operated from the ITS Cavour carrier and ITS Trieste LHD.

As for the ITS Trieste, the document confirms funding for the final integration works to enable full F-35B operations from the LHD. The goal is to create an alternate carrier capability when Cavour is unavailable.

Air Force Programs

The Italian Air Force maintains the central role in the national modernization strategy, with a broad range of programs confirmed or expanded.

The acquisition of the Gulfstream G550-based CAEW, JAMMS, and EA variants continues, providing a full Airborne Early Warning and Electronic Warfare suite with the P-MMMS (Piattaforma Multi-Missione, Multi- Sensore/Multi-Mission, Multi-Sensor Platform). As part of this program, Italy is procuring the EA-37B Compass Call and renewing the lease of the Spydr SIGINT aircraft until the new systems enter service.

Unmanned aerial systems are another big focus. The Air Force is proceeding with the MQ-9A Block 5 upgrade and the acquisition of additional airframes, as well as the participation in the EUROMALE program. Moreover, the service will procure in the very short term new Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) with kinetic capabilities, to be used as capability enhancers to implement a new command and control architecture. Notably, an Italian delegation recently visited Baykar in Turkey.

As mentioned earlier, the Air Force will also co-lead the acquisition of six M3A platforms with the Navy, strengthening maritime patrol and ASW capabilities that were lost after the Breguet Atlantic’s retirement.

The new DPP confirmed the procurement of the 24 new Eurofighter Typhoon Tranche 4 aircraft to replace the Tranche 1 fleet, which is set to be retired by 2029, alongside the new batch of 25 F-35s (15 F-35A and 10 F-35B), bringing the total planned fleet to 115 aircraft. Similarly, it confirmed the plan to acquire 20 new M-346 trainers, 15 of which will equip the Frecce Tricolori aerobatic team as replacements for the aging MB-339PAN, with five additional aircraft joining the International Flight Training School (IFTS) at Decimomannu Air Base.

The GCAP (Global Combat Air Programme) also sees a renewed funding, adding over €1 billion, for the development of the sixth-generation fighter and its ecosystem.

Similarly to the Army, air defenses assigned to the Air Force will see an expansion of short- and medium-range systems, including additional MAADS (Medium Advanced Air Defense System) units equipped with CAMM-ER (Common Antiair Modular Missile – Extended Range) and five new SAMP/T New Generation (NG) batteries.
