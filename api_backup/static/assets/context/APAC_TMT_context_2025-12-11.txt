[TITLE]Asia's strong equity deals pipeline to be tested by AI bubble concerns in 2026:
[TEXT]
By Kane Wu, Vibhuti Sharma and Yantoultra Ngui

HONG KONG/MUMBAI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A strong pipeline of high-profile IPOs by companies in China and India looking to tap into a move by investors to diversify bets will bolster Asian equity capital deals next year, although worries over soaring ​tech valuations could drag on momentum.

Asian equity capital market (ECM) deals, including initial public offerings (IPOs), follow-ons and convertible bonds, have totalled $267 billion so far this year, ‌up 15% from 2024 in the first annual rise since 2021, LSEG data showed.

Hong Kong, the preferred listing destination for Chinese companies, dominated regional ECM deals with $75 billion so far in 2025, more than triple ‌what was raised there last year and the highest since 2021, the data showed.

India, meanwhile, has raised $19.3 billion via IPOs so far this year, LSEG data showed, down 6% from 2024's record $20.5 billion haul. The 2025 data does not include e-commerce platform Meesho's $604 million IPO that is underway this week.

"China's recovery and India's continued expansion have been the twin engines driving equity issuance across Asia this year," said James Wang, head of Asia ex-Japan ECM at Goldman Sachs.

"We expect both markets to remain central to regional deal flow in ⁠2026," he said. "We are still in the early stages of ‌a broader upswing ... supported by Asia's economic growth and improving corporate earnings."

India is set to generate as much as $20 billion from IPOs in 2026, according to a forecast by investment banking firm Equirus Capital. Over 300 companies have filed for Hong Kong listings, public ‍disclosures showed.

Landmark offerings such as the IPO of India's Reliance Jio Platforms and the Hong Kong second listing of China's Zhongji Innolight Co are expected to lift volumes significantly in 2026, advisers said.

PIVOTING AWAY FROM US ASSETS

Asia has benefited from a global move by investors to diversify their portfolios, pivoting away from U.S. assets in recent months amid uncertainties about U.S. President Donald Trump's ​trade and geopolitical policies.

"In periods of U.S. turbulence, we often see capital rotate toward Asia in search of diversification and structural upside," said Li He, partner and ‌Asia ex-Japan co-head at law firm Davis Polk.

"The recovery of 2025 was not a flash in the pan. It reflected deep liquidity pools across the region and an unmistakable shift toward frontier technologies that are reshaping how we manufacture, consume and interact."

[TITLE]L&G Asset Management sees AI equity upside despite US$3 trillion debt concerns:
[TEXT]
British institutional investor L&G Asset Management is not perturbed by the rising debt issuance in the artificial intelligence sector, even as it sees opportunities in the equities of industry giants.

Credit related to the AI sector could grow between US$500 billion and US$800 billion a year and reach nearly US$3 trillion by 2030, according to Ben Bennett, head of investment strategy in Asia at the asset management firm known for its active fixed income strategies.

"We are defensive in terms of allocating to that particular sector," said Bennett, whose firm manages some US$1.5 trillion of assets.
