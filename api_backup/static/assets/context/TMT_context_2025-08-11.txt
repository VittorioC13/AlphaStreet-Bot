[TITLE]Verb Technology Company (Nasdaq: VERB) Successfully Closes $558 Million Private Placement to Launch First Publicly Listed TON Treasury Strategy Company, in Partnership with Kingsway Capital:
[TEXT]
LAS VEGAS, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verb Technology Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: VERB) (“the Company”), today announced the successful closing of its previously announced upsized and oversubscribed $558 million private placement (“PIPE transaction”), in partnership with Kingsway Capital (“Kingsway”). The completion of the PIPE transaction marks a critical milestone in the Company’s plans to become the first and largest publicly traded treasury reserve of Toncoin ($TON). $TON is the native cryptocurrency of TON blockchain, the blockchain integrated with Telegram, one of the world's most widely used messaging platforms.

The PIPE transaction, which priced approximately 58.7 million shares of common stock, included participation from over 110 institutional and crypto-native investors, led by Kingsway and anchored by Vy Capital, Blockchain.com, Ribbit Capital, and Graticule (GAMA). Additional investors include CMCC Global, Pantera, MEXC Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Luxor Capital, Arrington Capital, Animoca, Kraken, Primitive Ventures, BitGo, FalconX, Orbs Group, The Open Platform (TOP), TVM Ventures, Kenetic, Hivemind Capital, UNCAP, Pacific Coast Venture Partners, and several high-profile crypto founders like Guy Young, Founder of Ethena Labs.

“As the exclusive blockchain infrastructure powering Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem, we believe in the utility and potential growth in adoption of Toncoin,” said Manuel Stotz, incoming Executive Chairman. “With today’s completed placement and the backing of an exceptional list of investors, we are building a next-generation treasury platform to define a new category of digital asset reserves.”

Company Strategy

The Company plans to immediately begin using the majority of the net proceeds from the PIPE transaction to acquire $TON, which will serve as its primary treasury reserve asset. The strategy is expected to generate sustainable staking rewards to initiate, manage, and grow the Company’s $TON exposure in a cash flow positive manner. The Company intends to rebrand as TON Strategy Co. (“TSC”) to reflect its new direction. In addition, the Company will continue to operate its existing business units, each of which leverages its social commerce technology and video marketing expertise, which are expected to expand.

Company Leadership and Special Advisor

As previously announced, the Company will be led by a deeply experienced team driving its digital asset strategy:

Executive Chairman Manuel Stotz is the Founder & CEO of Kingsway and serves as President of the TON Foundation.
