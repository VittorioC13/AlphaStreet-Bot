[TITLE]Iraq signs preliminary deal with U.S. Chevron on oil project:
[TEXT]
BAGHDAD, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Oil Ministry on Tuesday signed a principle agreement with U.S. energy company Chevron.

Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani sponsored the signing ceremony of the deal "regarding the Nasiriyah project, which included four exploration blocks, and the development of the Balad oil field along with other producing fields and exploration blocks," a statement by al-Sudani's media office said.

Al-Sudani said the Iraqi government has been working to attract companies to operate in Iraq while prioritizing the advancement of the oil sector, whether in production, refining, associated gas and natural gas production, or the use of the latest technologies to develop this vital sector.

For his part, Chevron's vice president Frank Mount expressed his company's aspiration to work in Iraq, describing it as a country rich in opportunities and endowed with vast natural and human resources.

Iraq's economy relies heavily on crude oil exports, which account for about 90 percent of the country's revenues.

[TITLE]Oil awaits Zelenskiy-Trump meeting clues on peace deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices held steady today as traders awaited clues from a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as they attempt to come to a peace deal to end Europe's deadliest war in 80 years.

Brent crude futures stood at $65.87 a barrel this morning, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was up nine cents, or 0.14%, to $62.89 a barrel.

Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Saturday and emerged more aligned with Moscow on seeking a peace deal instead of a ceasefire first.

"Market focus now shifts to today's Washington meeting for signs of a deal that could eventually boost crude and gas supply. Meanwhile, in the week to August 12, speculators held the first-ever combined net short position in WTI (CME & ICE), leaving prices exposed to any upside surprises," said Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy, Ole Hansen.

"I don't believe the oil market has priced in a full peace dividend that potentially could see prices of crude and EU gas suffer further setbacks," Hansen added.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro's comments around India's purchases of Russian crude funding Moscow's war in Ukraine led to crude ticking up earlier in the session.

"India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs," Navarro said.

"The US adviser's sharp words on India's Russian crude imports, paired with postponed trade talks, revive concerns that energy flows remain hostage to trade and diplomatic frictions, even as peace prospects in Ukraine brighten," said Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova.

On Saturday, Trump said he did not immediately need to consider retaliatory tariffs on countries such as China for buying Russian oil but might have to "in two or three weeks", cooling initial concerns about a disruption in Russian supply.

China, the world's biggest oil importer, is the largest buyer of Russian oil, followed by India.

Investors are also watching for clues from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments at this week's Jackson Hole meeting regarding the path of US interest rate cuts that could boost stocks to further records.

[TITLE]Centrica Signs 10 Year Deal for USA Natural Gas With Devon Energy:
[TEXT]
The deal expands Centrica's global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office.

Centrica Plc signed a 10-year agreement to buy natural gas from Devon Energy Corp. to help expand its activities across the Atlantic.

Centrica Energy, its trading arm, will receive 50,000 million British thermal units per day of natural gas from 2028, or the equivalent of five liquefied natural gas cargoes per year, according to a statement on Friday. The volumes will be indexed to TTF, the European benchmark price.

The deal expands Centrica’s global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office. The agreement will also help the firm to manage the price risk in its liquefied natural gas portfolio by aligning feed gas rates with European futures. For Devon, the deal offers exposure to international markets, according to the statement.

“Gas remains an essential transition fuel and, through long-term agreements like this, Centrica ensures competitively-indexed gas supply,” said Centrica Chief Executive Officer Chris O’Shea.

US natural gas producers are increasingly seeking to lock in agreements with buyers overseas. Both the Asian and the European benchmarks for the heating and power-generation fuel trade at roughly four times the price at Henry Hub in Louisiana, the US benchmark.

In February, Centrica signed a 15-year agreement to supply American LNG to Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and last year it struck a deal with US-based Coterra Energy Inc. to secure more gas.

[TITLE]Inox Wind sells ₹175 crore stake in EPC subsidiary at ₹7,400 crore valuation:
[TEXT]
Inox Wind Limited announced that it has sold a stake worth approximately ₹175 crores in its engineering, procurement and construction subsidiary Inox Renewable Solutions Ltd. to investors. The transaction values the subsidiary at around ₹7,400 crores post-merger.

The stake sale involves Inox Renewable Solutions Ltd., formerly known as Resco Global Wind Services Pvt. Ltd., which serves as the EPC arm of India’s leading wind energy solutions provider. The valuation reflects the post-merger value following a recent corporate restructuring where the substation business from Inox Green was demerged and merged into IRSL, which received regulatory approval from stock exchanges.

Inox Renewable Solutions ranks among India’s top two wind EPC service providers with over 14 years of operational experience. The company provides end-to-end renewable project services from conceptualization to commissioning, including transmission infrastructure construction. It has expanded its offerings to include crane services, transformer manufacturing, and power evacuation asset hybridization.

The subsidiary benefits from strong revenue visibility through Inox Wind’s diversified order book of approximately 3.1 GW with a healthy pipeline. IRSL operates across India with a strong presence in western regions and is developing multi-gigawatt scale common infrastructure for future renewable projects.

Inox Wind Limited is part of the $12 billion INOXGFL Group and operates four manufacturing plants with a 2.5 GW annual capacity.

The shares of Inox Wind Limited were trading at ₹144.25 up by ₹4.26 or 3.04 per cent on the NSE at 11.27 am.

The smell of yeast still hangs in the air at the Vivergo plant in Hull but the machines have fallen quiet.

More than 100 lorries usually pass through here each day, carrying 3,000 tonnes of wheat. It is milled, fermented and distilled. The final product is bioethanol, a renewable fuel that is then blended into E10 petrol.

This is a vast operation. It took several years to build, with considerable investment, but it is on the verge of closing down. Management and staff are holding out for a last-minute reprieve from the government but time is running out.

[TITLE]Duke Energy promises over $1 billion in savings over a decade from merger of North, South Carolina utilities:
[TEXT]
Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That’s after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina — including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They would all continue to regulate the combined utility.
