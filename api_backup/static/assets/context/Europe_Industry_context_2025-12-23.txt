[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]JPMorgan Maintains Overweight Rating On Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG):
[TEXT]
Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is among 10 Best Performing Electrical Infrastructure Stocks in 2025.

JPMorgan Maintains Overweight Rating On Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG)

On December 16, 2025, TheFly reported that JPMorgan reduced its price objective for Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) from $422 to $410 and maintained its Overweight rating. As per the firm, the modification is a result of revisions made to its financial model following the release of its third-quarter report.

Separately, on December 5, 2025, Reuters reported that Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had achieved a settlement on the requirements needed to finalize the $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine Corporation. According to Reuters, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accepted the purchase, subject to Calpine selling four generating assets in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) would divest three natural gas-fired power plants under the terms of the agreement with the DOJ: the York 2 facility in Pennsylvania, the Jack Fusco Energy Center near Houston, Texas, and a minority interest in the Gregory Power facility near Corpus Christi. According to the DOJ, these divestitures ease concerns that the transaction may lessen competition and increase power costs in the PJM Interconnection and Electric Reliability of Texas markets.

The Calpine acquisition came to light in January and is one of the largest transactions in the US power industry. Reuters reported that the agreement coincides with increased electrification in buildings and transportation, as well as growing electricity demand associated with AI data centers.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is a supplier of energy products and services as well as a manufacturer of carbon-free energy.

While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The Adani Group ’s decision to pause international airport expansion and instead concentrate capital and managerial resources on India marks a decisive turn in its infrastructure strategy. As said by Jeet Adani , director at Adani Airport Holdings , the group is no longer viewing airports merely as transportation assets. Instead, it is repositioning them as multi-dimensional urban platforms where aviation, real estate, retail, hospitality and digital services intersect to create long-term, high-margin growth.This shift from airside operations to city-side development has far-reaching implications for Adani’s business model as well as for how airports are monetised in India.Currently, Adani Airports operates eight airports handling close to 90 million passengers annually. Even without acquiring new airports, passenger volumes across this portfolio are expected to grow to around 150 million over the next three to five years through capacity additions and rising air travel demand. The group also intends to bid for nearly a dozen airports slated for privatisation, reinforcing its ambition to become India’s dominant private airport operator.A central driver of Adani’s city-side push lies in the economics of airport businesses Aeronautical revenues , which is derived from landing fees, parking charges and passenger service fees, are tightly regulated and typically offer returns of around 12%. In contrast, non-aeronautical revenues such as retail, food and beverage, lounges and services can generate returns exceeding 20%.At present, aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues are split roughly 50:50 across Adani’s airport portfolio. Jeet Adani has indicated that this mix will change dramatically over time. Aeronautical revenues are expected to shrink to around 10% of total revenues, while non-aero businesses such as retail, F&B (food and beverage), lounges and services could account for 40–50%, and city-side development another 30–40%.This transformation explains why the airport business, though already Ebitda positive, is not yet cash positive due to heavy capital expenditure. Adani expects the airports unit to turn cash positive within 18–24 months, reducing its dependence on Adani Enterprises for growth capital. Funding for the Rs 1 lakh crore expansion plan will largely come from internal accruals, supplemented by project-level debt and selective equity raises.Unlike traditional airport operators who focus on throughput, Adani’s strategy is centred on maximising transactions per passenger. Currently, roughly one in three passengers at its airports makes a commercial transaction. The stated goal is to raise this to one in two and eventually beyond.A key differentiator is Adani’s vertically integrated approach. The group owns and operates most components of the airport ecosystem such as retail, food and beverage, lounges and ground handling, giving it tighter control over pricing, customer experience and cross-selling opportunities . These activities are housed in two joint ventures where Adani holds majority stakes. Flamingo is the partner for retail, while Travel Food and Services and AJ Kitchen of Abu Dhabi are partners in food, lounges and hospitality services This integration allows Adani to treat the airport not as a passive business but as an active commercial environment driven by consumer data, dwell time and spending behaviour.The most significant evolution in Adani’s airport strategy is the aggressive push into city-side development. Work is already underway at Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Lucknow, with Guwahati set to follow. These projects go far beyond terminal buildings and parking facilities.Navi Mumbai International Airport is the clearest expression of this vision. The area around the airport is being developed as a full-fledged urban destination encompassing hospitality, retail, office space, entertainment venues and a 25,000-seat arena, alongside aviation-linked infrastructure. The intent is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where airports act as economic anchors for entire districts.This approach mirrors global trends seen in cities such as Amsterdam, Seoul and Singapore, where airport-led urban clusters generate value far beyond aviation.According to The Times of India, Adani Group is preparing for a large-scale entry into India’s hospitality sector, anchored around its airport and real estate businesses. The group plans to develop more than 60 hotels across the country, primarily linked to airports it operates and major real estate projects it controls. With the exception of the Sahara Star hotel near Mumbai airport’s Terminal 1, most of these hotels will be developed in-house.Navi Mumbai alone is expected to host

[TITLE]Dangote the Whistle-Blower: Wealth vs. Nigerian Corruption:
[TEXT]
A Yoruba maxim, Isàlè òrò ò lè gbín, meaning, the foundation of wealth is never spotless, gained new urgency on December 16, 2025, when Nigeria’s most powerful industrialist turned his own megaphone toward the very system that underwrites his empire. Aliko Dangote’s public indictment of a senior regulator was not merely a personal grievance; it was a stark reminder that in the Nigerian imagination wealth functions simultaneously as shield and sword, and that the sword can be turned inward.

On that harmattan‑laden morning, the press gallery overlooking the sprawling Dangote Petroleum Refinery in Lekki was unusually full. Reporters shuffled notes, cameras flickered, and a low murmur of anticipation rippled through the room. When Dangote stepped onto the modest podium, the atmosphere shifted instantly. He lifted a sealed envelope, announced that its contents would be forwarded to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, and identified his target: Faruk Ahmed, chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.

The envelope held no courteous petition. It contained a charge sheet replete with copies of overseas property titles, a fleet of European luxury cars and flight logs of a private jet whose monthly fuel bill could sustain a dozen ministers. Ahmed was accused of living “vastly beyond his official remuneration”.

Why would a man whose public persona is that of a reticent industrialist assault the very regulatory framework that makes his refinery possible? The answer lies in a tangle of frustration, self‑preservation and a psychological calculus forged by years of watching ordinary petitions dissolve into dusty archives. For years, the NMDPRA has been subject to hushed complaints

[TITLE]CO2 Batteries That Store Grid Energy Take Off Globally:
[TEXT]
This giant bubble on the island of Sardinia holds 2,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. But the gas wasn’t captured from factory emissions, nor was it pulled from the air. It came from a gas supplier, and it lives permanently inside the dome’s system to serve an eco-friendly purpose: to store large amounts of excess renewable energy until it’s needed.

Developed by the Milan-based company Energy Dome, the bubble and its surrounding machinery demonstrate a first-of-its-kind “CO2 Battery,” as the company calls it. The facility compresses and expands CO 2 daily in its closed system, turning a turbine that generates 200 megawatt-hours of electricity, or 20 MW over 10 hours. And in 2026, replicas of this plant will start popping up across the globe.

We mean that literally. It takes just half a day to inflate the bubble. The rest of the facility takes less than two years to build and can be done just

[TITLE]San Jose races to become Bay Area’s data center capital — PG&E customers could pay the price:
[TEXT]
In the rush to build colossal data-processing centers for Silicon Valley’s suddenly booming artificial intelligence industry, San Jose is positioning itself as the Bay Area’s epicenter for data center development, dominating PG&E’s internal “pipeline” of proposed and under-construction projects it plans to power.

PG&E’s “data center project pipeline” shows that for San Jose, it has received requests to supply electricity to 11 projects totaling 1,630 megawatts of capacity — enough for 1.2 million homes, more than three times the number of housing units in San Jose. Hayward trails in second place, with four projects for 975 megawatts.

Data centers hold thousands of computer chips that process AI tasks, from chatbot queries to complex scientific research. Amid a global frenzy over AI, major Silicon Valley technology companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars, with venture capitalists backing hundreds of Bay Area AI startups.

[TITLE]Wall Street Firms Cut AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (AIRO) Price Target But Affirm Long-Term Prospects:
[TEXT]
AIRO Group Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRO) is one of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts. Colin Canfield of Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed his Buy rating on AIRO Group Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRO) on December 11, keeping his $20 price target unchanged.

Wall Street Firms Cut AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (AIRO) Price Target But Affirm Long-Term Prospects

On November 24, BTIG analyst Andre Madrid lowered the price target on the stock to $19 from $26 while reiterating a Buy rating. The cut is in response to disappointing third-quarter results, in which sales dropped to $6.3 million from $23.7 million in the same quarter a year ago.

Meanwhile, on November 21, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its overweight rating on AIRO Group but cut the price target to $20 from $30. While the research firm cut the price target over concerns that third-quarter results disappointed, it maintains the company represents significant value as a key drone supplier in the US and the European Union.

A point of concern is that the company’s increased focus and concentration on drone revenue, which represents 80% of 2025 sales, creates inherent quarterly volatility. Nevertheless, the research firm has echoed the company’s solid gross profit margins that stand at 63.78%. Cantor Fitzgerald expects the company to address radio-related supply chain challenges by sourcing from multiple suppliers while receiving priority as a national security provider.

AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRO) is a next-generation aerospace and advanced air mobility company focused on defense and commercial markets, operating through four segments: Drones (developing and selling unmanned systems), Avionics (creating flight technology for various aircraft), Training (providing military pilot and commercial flight training), and Electric Air Mobility (developing eVTOLs for cargo and passengers).

While we acknowledge the potential of AIRO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Leonardo’s Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor Demonstrator Makes First Flight in Italy:
[TEXT]
The NGCTR demonstrator is designed to mature key novel technologies that could support the development of a larger civil tiltrotor with lower emissions.

Leonardo has announced the first flight of the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor – Technology Demonstrator (NGCTR-TD), which took place on Dec. 19, 2025, at the company’s Cascina Costa facility in northern Italy. The flight marks a major milestone for one of Europe’s most advanced civil rotorcraft research programs, developed under the EU-funded Clean Sky 2 initiative.

The event formally opens the flight test phase for the demonstrator, which is intended to mature key technologies to be used for a future generation of high-speed, long-range civil tiltrotors. The NGCTR program aims to combine the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) flexibility typically shown by helicopters with the cruise performance similar to that of fixed-wing turboprop aircraft, while significantly reducing environmental impact.

#Leonardo and the EU @clean_aviation JU (Joint Undertaking) are pleased to announce the first flight of the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor – Technology Demonstrator (NGCTR-TD), which took place on 19 December at Leonardo’s Cascina Costa di Samarate facility (Varese, Italy).… pic.twitter.com/rGzNBnp4tU — Leonardo Helicopters (@LDO_Helicopters) December 19, 2025

First Flight

According to a video released by Leonardo, the first flight consisted only of a brief hovering sortie, meant to verify aircraft stability and overall system functionality before moving to longer tests. The flight was performed by Leonardo test pilot Gianfranco Cito at the Cascina Costa site, the same site where the aircraft was assembled and underwent ground testing.

Leonardo said that the first flight marks the start of a progressive flight-test campaign, during which the demonstrator’s flight envelope will be gradually expanded. Subsequent sorties will then focus on validating individual subsystems and, later on, more complex flight profiles, including transitions between helicopter and airplane modes, which are notoriously among the most critical flight phases for tiltrotors.

The NGCTR program reached another key milestone in July 2024, when the demonstrator successfully completed its first ground run tests. Those activities paved the way for flight clearance and ultimately led to the aircraft’s first flight in December 2025.

“Building on our well-established experience in the tiltrotor sector, bringing this technology demonstrator into the air for the first time represents an important milestone in our journey to make a key contribution toward an even more advanced, effective, and sustainable use of helicopter technologies in Europe. Vertical lift continues to deliver invaluable benefits to operators and communities across a wide range of missions worldwide; for this reason, we are committed to developing and delivering solutions that uniquely combine the best of both worlds – rotary-wing and fixed-wing architectures – unlocking entirely new capabilities.” — Gian Piero Cutillo, Managing Director of Leonardo Helicopters

Clean Sky 2 Framework

The NGCTR-TD was developed within Clean Sky 2, the European Union’s large-scale aeronautical research program under the Horizon 2020 framework. Clean Sky 2 was designed to reduce aviation emissions, noise, and operating costs while strengthening Europe’s aerospace industrial base. Its successor, Clean Aviation, continues to build on the technologies matured under the program.

Launched in 2015, the NGCTR initiative brought together industry, research centers, and academic institutions across Europe. According to Clean Aviation, the program involved more than 85 organizations from 15 countries, supported by over €100 million in EU funding distributed across multiple grant agreements.

Clean Sky 2 also placed particular focus on cross-border industrial collaboration and supply-chain development, using demonstrators such as NGCTR to create common design, manufacturing, and testing practices across Europe, explains Clean Aviation’s website. This approach was intended to ensure that the benefits of technology maturation extended beyond a single airframer, strengthening Europe’s long-term competitiveness in advanced rotorcraft and VTOL systems.

“The NGCTR demonstrates how Europe can turn ambition and vision into impact. The programme brought together more than 85 organisations from 15 countries around a shared objective: developing faster and more sustainable rotorcraft based on the tiltrotor architecture. With €116 million in EU funding distributed across more than 30 grant agreements, the outcomes extend well beyond the project itself. More than 20 patents have emerged from the NGCTR, and the programme has helped foster skills, industrial capabilities, and new European supply chains. This makes the NGCTR – launched under Clean Aviation’s predecessor programme, Clean Sky 2 – a key element in strengthening Europe’s strategic leadership in sustainable air transport.” — Axel Krein, Executive Director of the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking

Demonstrator Built on the AW609 Platform

The NGCTR builds directly on Leonardo’s decades of tiltrotor experience embodied by the AW609 program. The AW609 is currently considered one of the most significant technological innovations in the global aviation industry and might pave the way for a large-scale diffusion of the tiltrotor platforms, becoming the first commercial tiltrotor.

Because of this, rather than relying on an entirely new airframe, the NGCTR-TD uses a Leonardo AW609 fuselage as its baseline, allowing the program instead to focus resources on the validation of new technologies while reducing cost and technical risk. The aircraft is powered by GE Aerospace CT7 turboshaft engines.

Building on the AW609, the demonstrator intends to advance five core technology areas: an advanced wing architecture, an innovative tail layout, a non-tilting engine installation with a high-efficiency nacelle architecture and split-gearbox transmission, as well as an advanced, modular, distributed, and scalable Flight Control System (FCS). The innovative solutions developed and integrated into the NGCTR-TD contribute to reducing aerodynamic drag, optimizing engine installation, and mitigating the effects of emissions.

In fact, beyond designing and building the aircraft itself, the NGCTR was structured to raise key technologies to Technology Readiness Level 5–6 at whole-aircraft level. These outcomes are intended to feed directly into future civil tiltrotor designs and to support evolving European certification frameworks for high-speed VTOL aircraft.

Performance objectives

The NGCTR concept targets a cruise speed of around 280 kt (520 km/h) and a range of approximately 1,000 nautical miles (1,850 km). These figures place it well beyond conventional helicopters and closer to regional turboprop aircraft, while retaining VTOL capability.

Such performance is seen as particularly relevant for passenger transport, cargo operations, and search and rescue missions. In those situations, the ability to combine speed, range, and vertical access could significantly expand operational flexibility. Leonardo and Clean Aviation also emphasize the potential to operate without the need for extensive ground infrastructure.

The program also focuses on the environmental aspects, aiming to demonstrate reductions in CO₂ emissions, NOx emissions, and noise footprint compared to helicopters of similar size and payload. This aligns with the European Union’s climate and sustainable mobility objectives.

Long Development

While the first flight represents a major achievement, it follows a lengthy and complex development path. The NGCTR demonstrator’s maiden flight had originally been planned for 2020, before being delayed due to technical challenges and program restructuring.

Aircraft assembly was completed in June 2024, following a multi-year design and validation phase that included a critical design review at aircraft level in 2021. Ground testing culminated with the successful power-on milestone achieved in July 2024, enabling flight clearance for the December 2025 first flight.

The ongoing flight-test campaign is expected to accumulate up to 200 flight hours, progressively validating the demonstrator’s technologies.

European shares closed at a record high on ⁠Friday, driven by defence and insurance stocks, as investors turned optimistic with just a handful of trading days left before the end of the year after a selloff earlier this week.The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.4% to 587.50, a day after ‌logging its best ‌one-day performance in more than three weeks and ending the week up 1.7%.The index is on track for its best annual performance ‌since 2021, aided by falling interest rates and global investors diversifying from premium-valued U.S. technology stocks.Major regional markets were also higher, with Germany's DAX up 0.4% and London's FTSE 100 gaining 0.6%.Aerospace & defence stocks led sector gains, with heavyweight banks adding 0.8%. British lenders Standard Chartered, Barclays and HSBC all gained between 0.9% and 1.4%.The banking index has risen 65% so far this year, while defence is up almost 60%."Banks have been the big winner this year and we believe that they will ‌be winners ‍once again next year," said Robert Schramm-Fuchs, European equities portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, adding ‍that they were still trading at a discount to their historic ‌valuation in Europe."This does not make any sense, given the supportive environment banks find themselves in, including excess capital position and steep yield curves," he said.Personal and household goods and retail shares were the biggest decliners. Puma, Adidas and JD Sports fell between 1.2% and 3.5% after peer Nike tumbled on the impact of weak China sales on its quarterly results. Equities rebounded on Thursday after two days of tech-led losses as an unexpected slowdown in U.S. consumer price inflation strengthened expectations for further ‍Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and the European Central Bank maintained a hawkish stance."We had a little bit of a wobble towards the end of the year these last ‍few weeks," said Daniela ⁠Hathorn, senior market analyst at ⁠Capital.com. "A lot of the downside has been focused around overinvestment, realising that maybe these (tech) companies are not going to be able to deliver the amount of growth that has been priced in for the next few years."Cruise operator Carnival's London-listed shares were the day's strongest performers, jumping 16.6% to the top of STOXX 600 after it posted an upbeat annual profit forecast and reinstated its quarterly dividend.The European Union's decision to fund lending to Ukraine through borrowing was welcomed by markets, according to analysts, after the use of joint debt was approved while avoiding a legally contentious plan to use Russia's assets.
