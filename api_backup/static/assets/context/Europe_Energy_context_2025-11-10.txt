[TITLE]The energy chessboard of Europe moves to Athens: Today the Summit with American and European ministers – The deals for LNG:
[TEXT]
Marianna Tzanne November 6 08:54

The 6th Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Summit (P-TEC), being held today November 6 and tomorrow November 7 in Athens, is evolving into a pivotal milestone for shaping the new energy landscape of the country and for the further upgrade of Greece’s geopolitical position in Southeastern Europe.

The event, which draws the interest of top American officials and representatives of energy giants, constitutes a strong message for the deepening US–Europe cooperation in the field of energy, but also a critical step for new strategic deals that will redefine the map of natural gas flows and investments in the region.

Since yesterday in our country, and meeting with the Prime Minister at the Maximos Mansion, are US Interior Secretary and “Energy Czar” Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Undersecretary of State for Management and Resources Michael Rigas, and Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment Jacob Helberg.

Their presence in the Greek capital, along with senior executives from Cheniere Energy, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Venture Global LNG, and also technology giants such as Amazon and Google, underscores Greece’s new geostrategic role in Europe’s energy architecture.

The deals

Transatlantic cooperation in natural gas supply opened yesterday with DEPA Commercial and Aktor announcing the establishment of a joint venture for the supply and export of American LNG. The new company is named ATLANTIC SEE LNG, with a shareholding structure of 60% DEPA Commercial and 40% AKTOR. According to sources, the new entity will have a purely export-oriented character, with exclusive activity the transport of liquefied natural gas to Southeastern Europe.

The same sources note that the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the US state development bank, is expected to play a role in the joint venture. It remains to be seen from the announcements whether its role in the energy scheme will be financial or also equity. In any case, the involvement of the DFC, which also participates in other infrastructures in the country, is perceived as a clear message of American confidence and strategic investment in the Greek energy corridor.

ExxonMobil’s research in Crete also appears to be entering a new phase, with information indicating that the American giant is heading to a decision for an exploratory drilling.

The Vertical Corridor

The new cooperation between DEPA Commercial and Aktor at the heart of the Vertical Corridor will allow the flow of American LNG from Greece to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Ukraine.

According to information, Aktor will contribute to the agreement long-term LNG supply contracts of up to 2 bcm annually or even more, which will be channeled to Ukrainian companies, including the state energy company and the private DTEK group. The natural gas will come from American Venture Global LNG, based on a 20-year contract that is in the final stage of negotiation.

The project is part of the full utilization of the Alexandroupolis FSRU and the creation of new regasification terminals, such as the second Gastrade FSRU in Thrace – which has already received a positive opinion for the Environmental Impact Study.

As Gastrade executives recently said, the final investment decision for the project is expected within 2026, so that the new FSRU unit will be operational in 2028.

Given the planned capacity of 6 bcm of natural gas, the total investment cost is estimated between 550 and 600 million euros. For comparison, the existing Alexandroupolis FSRU, with a capacity of 5.5 bcm, cost about 500 million euros.

Gastrade, whose shareholders – Elmina Kopelouzos, DEPA, DESFA, Gaslog and Bulgartransgaz – jointly support the project, aims at the timely signing of station usage contracts. In this way, it seeks to secure the commercial viability of the project without having to proceed to a market test process. It should be noted that in 2024 natural gas consumption in the countries of the Vertical Corridor was 51 bcm and the forecast for 2030 is 68 bcm. This means that there will be a 17 bcm gap while additionally the approximately 15-16 bcm coming from Russia will be missing from the system.

The DFC and the “locking in” of European agreements

The conclusion of long-term contracts with European companies is estimated to be the “key” for activating financing from the US development organization DFC.

Such a development would open the way for the implementation of upgrade projects for the Vertical Corridor, through which American LNG will be able to be channeled from Greece to Hungary and Slovakia.

Thus, the Vertical Corridor will emerge as a main energy artery of Europe, simultaneously consolidating the role of Greece as a strategic fuel entry gate to the continent.

Acceleration factors

The conference takes place at a critical juncture, as European suppliers are preparing for the period after the end of 2027, when the supply of Europe with Russian natural gas will be fully discontinued.

At the same time, the clock is ticking for the implementation of the EU–US agreement, which provides for energy imports worth 750 billion dollars within three years, redefining the energy balance of the continent.

[TITLE]“Niet” via Athens to Russian gas – Two Americans and 25 European ministers in Greece for the EU’s energy independence:
[TEXT]
Nikos Meletis November 3 10:17

The war in Ukraine, the strategic confrontation with Russia, the redesign of Europe’s defense and energy security architecture under the lens of the new “aggressive and unconventional” U.S. foreign policy, provide, after several decades, a favorable opportunity for Greece to emerge as an energy hub and a provider of security in the wider region.

This time, after the collapse of projects such as the Burgas–Alexandroupolis pipeline and EastMed, the Vertical Gas Corridor, as a pillar of Eastern Europe’s and Ukraine’s energy security, is no longer a mere plan—it has taken shape. This week, it will officially receive U.S. support.

As the Vertical Corridor can now serve as a major gateway for U.S.—and not only—LNG to Eastern Europe and Ukraine, it represents a significant step toward Europe’s energy independence from Russia.

This independence has not only economic but also major geopolitical significance, as it deprives Russia of enormous financial resources for its war machine and simultaneously removes from Moscow the leverage it has held for decades to impose its influence even on key European countries such as Germany, Italy, Austria, Poland, and others.

The timing is favorable, coinciding with the EU’s decision to gradually halt purchases of Russian natural gas by the end of 2027, thus opening the path to seek new energy sources, mainly LNG, originating from the U.S., Qatar, and other emerging producers.

Priority

However, priority will be given to U.S. LNG, as this option has been directly linked by U.S. President Donald Trump to the new strategic balances being formed, as well as to maintaining the Transatlantic Relationship and EU-U.S. security cooperation at a high level. The Vertical Corridor also bypasses the Straits and the Black Sea, at a time when Turkey fails to comply with President Trump’s “instructions” to halt energy supplies from Russia.

Turkey, in a goodwill move, has entered into two agreements for long-term U.S. LNG purchase contracts. However, fully cutting off from Moscow is not easy, as it continues to purchase up to two-thirds of its imported oil from Russia, with discounts of up to 15%, saving billions of dollars and curbing inflation.

At the same time, over 40% of Turkey’s natural gas imports come from Russia at competitive prices. This choice by the Turkish president generates suspicion and caution, prompting the search for safer and more reliable solutions for transporting U.S. LNG to Eastern Europe.

Greece’s role in supplying Eastern Europe and Ukraine, through LNG infrastructure at Revythoussa and Alexandroupolis—a market estimated to need 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas after the Russian gas tap closure—is crucial.

This role will be confirmed next Thursday and Friday at the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Partnership (R-TEC) Summit, held in Greece with the participation of two top U.S. officials: Secretary of the Interior and Energy “Czar” Doug Bergman and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and possibly Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rega, while 24 Energy Ministers from the EU and the Balkans have been invited.

It is notable that the U.S. delegation will consist of nearly 50 people, including ministry officials and representatives of major U.S. companies, who will discuss cooperation and investment plans.

The Vertical Corridor will be the top agenda item. Holding this meeting in Athens is the result of choices made by the Trump team, as well as efforts by the Greek government, especially Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou and Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis.

At the meeting, the new U.S. ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle, is expected to make her first official appearance. She is expected to arrive in Athens over the weekend. On Tuesday, she will present her credentials to President Kosta Tasoulas, and on Wednesday she will host her first reception at the ambassadorial residence in honor of the two U.S. ministers, the accompanying businessmen, and the elite of the Greek business community, expected to attend in the residence’s garden on P. Kyriakou Street.

“Vote of confidence”

Beyond the obvious importance for Greece of this U.S. “vote of confidence,” it is extremely significant that the first major and substantive contact with the new U.S. administration is not for listing problems or requests, but for a dynamic, strategically important energy plan, which also has business significance for the United States.

Moreover, this plan involves individuals closely connected with President Trump, such as the three U.S. ministers and the new ambassador. During meetings with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, U.S. officials will review the full scope of bilateral relations, which are at an excellent point. Beyond energy issues, cooperation on defense and security remains a high priority.

For Athens, from the moment Trump assumed office, priority was given to identifying areas of convergence where bilateral relations could be repositioned compatibly with Trump’s view of transatlantic relations and the U.S. role in regional conflicts and confrontations.

The Middle East was a major test. However, due to Greece’s participation in the UN Security Council, there was an opportunity to develop a functional relationship with the U.S. on other regional issues.

Just last week, Gerapetritis communicated with U.S. Special Envoy for Africa Massad Boulos to discuss the Security Council resolution on the major Western Sahara crisis. Given the personal relationship that the U.S. president repeatedly claims to have with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Athens is attempting to build on-the-ground relations.

Consistent and reliable allied cooperation, spearheaded by the Souda naval base, military infrastructure facilitation, and the energy Vertical Corridor, which has economic but mainly geostrategic significance, creates a very positive foundation.

On this basis, daily discussions and major agreements are taking place, preparing for the supply of liquefied natural gas from the U.S. to Greece, targeting Eastern European countries via the Vertical Corridor.

In a few days, a commercial agreement is expected with a top U.S.-linked LNG production company for significant LNG supply, covering a period of more than 20 years.

The Greek government also awaits the new U.S. ambassador’s initiative, who has had phone communications with the Foreign Minister ahead of assuming her duties. Sources in Athens and Washington indicate she shows willingness for substantive work, arriving with specific proposals and aiming to deliver immediate results.

Cooperation

These proposals mainly concern energy sector cooperation, not limited to the Vertical Corridor. The goal is also to bring new U.S. companies to Greece, particularly in Renewable Energy, while cultural cooperation is also high on the agenda.

Those who met her during preparations for assuming her post describe Guilfoyle as sharp, active, and determined to contribute in her new role. On a personal level, she wants to prove she can meet the demands of her role and honor the choice made for her. She has already studied Greece’s dossier in depth before arriving in Athens and played a key role in organizing high-level contacts for Economy Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis in Washington.

Within the balances forming under Trump’s environment, special attention is paid to Guilfoyle’s relationship with Thomas Barrack, also a personal friend and Trump’s choice for U.S. ambassador to Ankara. Barrack is a strong, multifaceted personality, businessman with a wide network, but also a person with ideological biases regarding the region.

He has never hidden his admiration for Turkey and may attempt to overshadow other U.S. representatives in the region to impose his approaches and objectives. According to a U.S. source, despite some media reports, no initiative plans have emerged for regional issues.

5×5 Forum

Greece’s 5×5 forum initiative is being met with interest, as the U.S. has always favored multilateral cooperation frameworks in the region. For now, however, U.S. envoy Massad Boulos has focused on Libya, which also concerns Greece. Boulos had numerous contacts with all parties in Libya.

This week, he met with the President of Libya’s Presidential Council, Mohamed al-Menfi, while a post from the International Investment Conference in Saudi Arabia revealed that U.S. President Trump’s son Eric met with Khalifa Haftar’s son Belkacem, overseeing the Reconstruction Fund of Eastern Libya.

In Tripoli, a senior delegation from Chevron also held talks with the state company NOC and Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah to expand energy cooperation, which is particularly relevant given Chevron’s involvement in Greek offshore blocks south of Crete.

Starting point: Revythoussa

In the Vertical Corridor, an important first step was last week’s successful auction to secure LNG quantities that, starting from Revythoussa, will be sent via Bulgaria, Romania, and Moldova, with the final destination being Ukraine. Ukraine is making a titanic effort to ensure adequate energy reserves for the coming winter while critical energy infrastructure has suffered severe damage from Russian missiles.

This development is the result of coordinated action by Vertical Corridor operators: DESFA (Greece), Bulgartransgaz (Bulgaria), Transgaz (Romania), VestMoldTransgaz (Moldova), and GTSOU (Ukraine). These companies offered an attractive long-term program with lower transit fees, agreed upon in a meeting in Athens with Mr. Papastavrou.

This initiative comes at the right time, as Ukraine urgently needs gas imports. Estimates suggest import demand will increase by approximately 10% compared to initial plans. The Vertical Corridor will require additional major projects with significant investments, some of which will involve Greek energy and construction companies.

Beyond Revythoussa and the Alexandroupolis FSRU, a second FSRU is deemed necessary to meet demand, while back-to-back agreements for reselling gas to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, and Ukraine are being prepared. These plans are attractive for leading U.S. funds to participate through capital and guarantees, supporting the massive effort to rebuild Ukraine and reduce Eastern Europe’s dependency on Russian energy.

In Greek-U.S. cooperation, the involvement of major oil companies Chevron and ExxonMobil in blocks south and southwest of Crete is also important. These U.S. giants want to maintain a presence in the region, especially now that the hydrocarbon era is not ending as quickly as expected, particularly after Trump’s election, and amid doubts over rapid green transition plans.

For Greece, the presence of these U.S. giants in a sensitive region with unresolved maritime zones is extremely significant. Greece also plays a role in transporting Azeri gas via TANAP and TAP, as recent developments are expected to increase capacity to meet additional needs.

Alexandroupolis as key

Rapid developments in Europe’s energy independence from Russian gas now position Greece as an energy hub, with Alexandroupolis playing a decisive role.

The Vertical Corridor connecting Alexandroupolis with Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and through them Central European countries is no longer just a paper plan; with official U.S. support, it is entering the implementation phase.

The project aims to transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alexandroupolis to Europe. LNG will arrive by ship at the FSRU facilities in Alexandroupolis, where it will be regasified and sent into the vertical pipeline. The pipeline will also operate bidirectionally, able to receive natural gas from the Caspian via TAP.

Implementing this ambitious project ensures Europe’s energy security and independence from Russia. It creates the possibility of diversifying sources (suppliers) and gas routes. In the future, the bidirectional Vertical Corridor could also support the green transition, as the same network could transport environmentally friendly hydrogen.

The entire project is strategically significant for all of Europe, which is why the EU supports it, designating it a “project of common interest,” with the associated implications for financing and implementation support.

[TITLE]Europe's LNG Demand Surge Flips Global Gas Market:
[TEXT]
Major LNG suppliers like Exxon and Qatar are threatening to stop doing business with the EU over the new Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which would require tracking supply chain emissions and human rights records.

Asia has been the driver of global demand for liquefied natural gas for years now, with its fast-growing economies guzzling energy at elevated rates. This year, however, has seen this change. Asian demand for LNG is weakening—but Europe’s is on a substantial rise, more than offsetting Asia’s weakness, despite plans to reduce consumption of all hydrocarbons.

LNG imports to Asia last month stood at 22.84 million tons, Kpler data, cited by Reuters’ Clyde Russell, showed. This was a slight increase from September but palpably lower than October 2024, when imports hit 24.39 million tons. Over the first ten months of the year, Asia’s imports of liquefied gas were down by over 14 million tons on the year to 225.8 million tons. Russell suggests China was one driver of this trend, booking year-on-year LNG import declines every month since November 2024.

Yet while Asian energy importers curbed their purchases of liquefied gas, European buyers stepped up their orders. The Kpler data shows that over the first ten months of the year, Europe imported 101.38 million tons of the fuel. This was 16.75 million tons more than what Europe imported a year earlier—even as the EU leadership boasted

Reuters Two people died in a Russian strike on an apartment building in Dnipro

At least six people have died after Russia launched hundreds of missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure and residential targets in Ukraine overnight. A strike on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro killed two people and wounded 12, while three died in Zaporizhzhia. In all, 25 locations across Ukraine, including the capital city Kyiv, were hit, leaving many areas without electricity and heating. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram that major energy facilities were damaged in the Poltava, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, and work was under way to restore power. In Russia, the defence ministry said its forces had shot down 79 Ukrainian drones overnight.

The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched more than 450 exploding bomber drones and 45 missiles. Nine missiles and 406 drones were reportedly shot down. The Ukrainian Energy Ministry said there were power cuts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa and Kirovohrad regions, but restoration work was ongoing. Svyrydenko said critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected, and water supply is being maintained using generators.

[TITLE]Trump boosts Hungary's far-right Orbán with Russian energy sanctions carveout:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump has handed his authoritarian Hungarian ally Viktor Orbán a special exemption from Russian energy sanctions, a major boost for the far-right populist whose 15-year rule has been used as a blueprint by the MAGA movement.

Orbán visited Trump in Washington on Friday, with one of his explicit goals being to win a carveout from the latest sanctions imposed against Russian oil and gas companies last month.

Hungary is a major importer of Russian energy, and the sanctions were set to squeeze its already ailing economy ahead of elections next year that present the biggest challenge to what the European Union calls Orbán’s “hybrid regime of electoral autocracy.”

In a post on X, Orbán said he had received a guarantee of “full sanction exemptions” for key pipelines, allowing Hungary to continue providing “the lowest energy prices in Europe.”

He said Hungary was in a “significantly different situation” from other European countries, suggesting it would be “impossible” to secure affordable energy if sanctions remained in place.

A White House official told Reuters that Hungary has received a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions for using Russian oil and gas.

Hungary has meanwhile agreed to buy U.S. liquefied natural gas, the State Department said, noting contracts were expected to be worth about $600 million.

The two nations also agreed to work together on nuclear energy, with Hungary agreeing to purchase American nuclear fuel, which it currently buys from Russia.

Under Orbán’s premiership, Hungary is one of the only E.U. member states to maintain warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orbán has also cultivated close ties with Trump’s allies in Washington, sharing CPAC stages, coordinating through think tanks and syncing anti-immigrant and anti-woke messaging across the Atlantic.

In comments to state radio last week, Orbán made clear he would try to “make the Americans understand” that Hungary needs a carveout for its continued purchases of Russian energy.

And Hungarian officials said in the run-up to the meeting that the prime minister aimed to discuss a path to a U.S.-Russia meeting and seek exemptions from U.S. energy sanctions. International Monetary Fund figures show Hungary relied on Russia for 74% of its gas and 86% of its oil in 2024.

Trump canceled his planned summit with Putin, which was slated to take place in Hungary’s capital, Budapest, after the Russian leader stuck to his hard-line demands on ending his war in Ukraine.

[TITLE]The Case for a European-Chinese Green Pact:
[TEXT]
China and Europe share a strategic interest in advancing the green transition not only within their own borders, but also across emerging markets and developing economies. With America waging war on the global climate agenda, the world's remaining climate leaders must find a way to deepen ties.

GENEVA/PARIS – In early 2021, the European Union shelved the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment it had negotiated with China after the United States signaled its disapproval. At the time, deferring to the new US administration seemed prudent, because Europe was eager to rebuild transatlantic unity after Donald Trump’s first term. For a while, it looked like a wise move: US President Joe Biden soon rejoined the Paris climate agreement and proclaimed that “America is back.”

To be sure, the relationship between Europe and the Biden administration was not frictionless, especially after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which mobilized tens of billions of dollars to support US industries. Overall, though, transatlantic disputes were contained, and America’s steadfast support for Ukraine appeared to have shored up transatlantic relations.

But since Trump’s return to the White House, transatlantic solidarity has again curdled into strategic vulnerability. Sweeping US tariffs have hurt friends and foes alike. Fearing a complete withdrawal of US military support for Ukraine (or worse), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to a one-sided handshake trade deal with Trump in Scotland. Meanwhile, the US has continued to dismantle the postwar order, regarding it as what Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls a “weapon being used against us.”

After again withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, Trump is actively undermining renewable energy and climate action more broadly. In mid-October, the US unilaterally sabotaged a recently agreed International Maritime Organization compact on reducing emissions from shipping; and this month, it will do what it can to derail an ambitious agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil.

Tragically, with the world missing meaningful chances to keep global temperatures near the Paris targets, the risk of a deeper unraveling has grown. That may suit US short-term interests and the fossil-fuel lobbies, but it will spell disaster for the planet – especially the most vulnerable developing countries.

The one point on which Republicans and Democrats agree is that China must not be allowed to supplant the US as the de facto leader of the international order. While the latest rapprochement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may de-escalate bilateral tensions for a while, it certainly does not change the nature of a rivalry that will shape international relations for many years, if not decades.

Faced with American nationalism and Chinese assertiveness, Europe can no longer afford strategic passivity. Despite its economic weight, it has not been a player in this game, and certainly not in the contest for global dominance.

As a supporter of a rules-based international order, Europe cannot side comfortably with either China or Trump’s America. But in an increasingly multipolar world, it does have enough clout to tilt the balance one way or another. While it has so far sided with the US, the Trump administration’s unpredictability and belligerence give Europe reason to consider alternative options.

Yes, the EU has its own grievances vis-à-vis China. But the two also have ample common ground, not least when it comes to climage change and the energy transition. As the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gases and top producer of clean tech, China’s manufacturing future hinges on the success of the global green transition.

China and Europe thus share a strategic interest in advancing the climate transition across emerging markets and low-income countries. After all, the fate of the climate – and of the natural environment – increasingly depends on developing economies, which already account for the bulk of current and future emissions. If their growth continues to be powered by fossil fuels, the resulting climate-driven damage will impose mounting costs on everyone. As we show in a recent policy paper, it is far more cost-effective to help emerging markets and developing economies expand through renewable energy than to pay for rapidly increasing climate-related costs.

To that end, a pragmatic partnership between Europe and China could help not only Europe and China, but all current and future generations. What would it take to pull it off? Given low mutual trust, several conditions must be met.

First, trade frictions must not become a stumbling block as Chinese net exports surge (owing to weak domestic demand), and as trade is redirected away from the US and toward Europe. To prevent increased frictions, both sides must show maturity and agree on a clear quid pro quo.

As French and German economists proposed in a recent memo to both governments, Chinese access to the European market should be unconditional for certain goods such as solar panels, but still conditional on Chinese direct investment in, and technology transfers to, Europe for goods like electric vehicles; at the same time, imports should remain severely restricted in certain industries deemed critical for national security.

The second and most challenging condition is geopolitical. Most Chinese analysts regard Europe as a mere vassal of the US, and see the war in Ukraine as a conflict between the latter and Russia over their relative spheres of influence.

Europeans, of course, have a different reading. They see Russia as an aggressive neo-imperial power that aims to get its hands on Europe if it can manage to neutralize Ukraine. In a context where the US is increasingly fixated on Asia and the rivalry with China, the Kremlin’s brazen hybrid war on Western Europe makes its intentions clear. A trade and climate partnership would serve the common interest of both China and Europe. But it can be envisioned only if China ends its support for Russian aggression and adopts a more neutral stance. The quid pro quo would be that Europe asserts real strategic autonomy vis-à-vis the US.

If Europe and China can meet these conditions, they can lay the foundation for a green, rules-based partnership – not against America, but in defense of the global commons and their own future.

[TITLE]Greece woos US energy deals, as eco groups cry foul:
[TEXT]
Mitsotakis said the agreement would open 'a new chapter in Greece's energy history' - Copyright AFP Angelos TZORTZINIS

Hélène COLLIOPOULOU

Greece on Friday hailed as “historic” a deal with US energy giant ExxonMobil that could see the country’s first offshore drilling project in 40 years.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the agreement would open “a new chapter in Greece’s energy history”, coming on the heels of an exploration deal with Chevron last month.

His government has long sought to position Greece as a key player in gas deliveries to Europe, as Washington seeks every opportunity to squeeze out Russia’s energy influence in the region.

Environmental campaigners however criticised the deal, saying it represented a “huge risk” for whales and dolphins living in the local depths.

The deal was signed Thursday on the sidelines of a two-day conference in Athens attended by four members of the US cabinet including Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Energy ministers from more than 20 countries and senior energy company executives also attended.

Under the agreement, ExxonMobil will hold a 60-percent stake in an existing venture of London-listed Energean and Greece’s Helleniq Energy to explore in the Ionian Sea west of Corfu.

Exploratory drilling in the Ionian could begin in the next 18 months, the prime minister said in a video message on social media.

Last month, Greece picked Chevron, another US energy giant, for hydrocarbon exploration in four marine areas in the Ionian Sea south of the Peloponnese, and south of Crete.

– Replacing Russian gas –

The agreement with ExxonMobil comes two weeks after most EU member states approved banning Russian natural gas imports by the end of 2027. The aim there is to cut off a major source of funding for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.

In recent years, Greece has been investing heavily in both renewable energy and natural gas to reduce its dependence on lignite.

The recent launch of the Trans-Adriatic pipeline connecting Greece and Bulgaria has enabled the country to contribute to the vertical corridor towards Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Hungary, and Slovakia.

The opening of storage infrastructure at the port of Alexandroupolis, near the Greek-Turkish border, where American LNG gas arrives, has also helped undermine Russia’s market in the region.

“Greece is the natural gateway for American liquefied natural gas to replace Russian gas in the region,” said Mitsotakis.

– Regional rivalry –

Athens has also been keen to get US commitment to the area to neutralise competing maritime claims by Libya, encouraged by Greece’s historic rival Turkey.

Libya angered Greece in 2019 by signing a maritime delimitation agreement with Turkey, which Athens argues disregards the rights of Greek islands, including Crete.

Ecology groups have been less impressed.

They have noted that the areas earmarked for hydrocarbon exploration in the Ionian Sea are near a planned marine park.

Greenpeace Greece on Friday said the government was engaged in “acrobatics”, simultaneously claiming it would protect marine species while allowing seismic surveys and other operations on the seabed.

It noted that the ExxonMobil field is near marine protected areas within the Hellenic Trench, a biodiversity hotspot in the Mediterranean and a habitat for several species of whales and dolphins.

Greenpeace added that the energy giant had a “significant history of operational accidents (leading to environmental disasters) and worker fatalities”.

Thedota Nantsou, policy director for WWF Greece, said the promotion of hydrocarbons entailed “a huge risk” of accidents and leaks.

“We cannot move towards the future of climate change by looking to the past with outdated tools like LNG,” she told AFP.

[TITLE]Voter fury emerges over skyrocketing electricity bills as AI stokes demand — and fears of a stock market bubble:
[TEXT]
Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year’s midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who’s footing the bill to power Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Meanwhile, concerns are growing over an AI bubble in stock markets. Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management business, said at the Fortune Global Forum just weeks ago that some AI stocks have “a little too much concentration.”

And Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told Fortune weeks earlier that she was “very concerned”

Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year’s midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who’s footing the bill to power Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that he’ll focus on affordability next year as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.

Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average — although not everywhere.

“There’s a lot of pressure on politicians to talk

[TITLE]Why U.S. Energy Bills Are Set To Keep Rising:
[TEXT]
The country's heavy reliance on natural gas for 40% of its electricity generation exposes consumers to rising gas prices, though a looming LNG export supply glut could eventually help to moderate costs.

The primary driver of increased costs is a sudden jump in power demand, largely from new data centers in regions like ERCOT and PJM, with overall demand projected to grow by 15% over the next decade.

U.S. electricity prices have surged 36% since 2021 and are projected to keep rising, with the EIA forecasting residential prices to hit 17.7 cents per kilowatt-hour by 2026.

Democrats' pitch on reining in energy prices helped them handily win Tuesday’s elections, with several candidates promising to freeze utility rates. Democrats also notched seats in Georgia’s utilities commission for the first time in nearly 20 years, a clear rebuke of the Georgia Public Service Commission after it hiked electricity rates six times over the past two years. Georgia Power residential customers are now paying an extra $516 per year on their electric bill from two years ago. But Georgia is hardly alone. Surging electricity costs have become a major flashpoint for U.S. consumers across the country, with more than 60% of Americans reporting utility bills as a leading source of financial strain.

After years of relatively stable prices, U.S. electricity prices have climbed significantly, amplifying financial stress for millions of consumers who have been grappling with inflation for years. U.S. electricity prices have surged 36% since 2021, averaging annual increases of
