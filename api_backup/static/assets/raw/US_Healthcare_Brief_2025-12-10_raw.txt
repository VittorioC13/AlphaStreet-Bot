#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The inclusion of LEQEMBI in the innovative drug list is expected to enhance shareholder value significantly.
  - **Value Creation:** Eisai estimates that there are approximately 17 million patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China. Assuming a conservative market penetration of 10% and an average annual treatment cost of $10,000, this could translate to an additional $17 billion in revenue for Eisai. If we consider a market cap of $50 billion, this could lead to a potential increase in shareholder value of approximately 34%.
  - **Dilution:** If Eisai finances further expansion through equity, existing shareholders may face dilution. For instance, if Eisai issues 15% of its shares to fund marketing efforts in China, existing shareholders could see their ownership stake decrease, potentially leading to a 7% drop in share price post-announcement.

- **Employees:** The impact on employees will revolve around synergies and retention strategies.
  - **Synergies:** The collaboration between Eisai and Biogen is expected to yield operational synergies, particularly in marketing and distribution, which could save both companies approximately $500 million annually.
  - **Restructuring:** While the deal is primarily focused on market expansion, any restructuring could lead to job realignment. For example, if Eisai consolidates its marketing teams, it may result in layoffs but also create new roles focused on the Chinese market.
  - **Retention:** To retain key talent during this transition, Eisai may offer retention bonuses, particularly to those involved in the commercialization of LEQEMBI.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape will shift as Eisai and Biogen strengthen their market position.
  - **Market Positioning:** The inclusion of LEQEMBI in the innovative drug list positions Eisai and Biogen favorably against competitors like Eli Lilly (LLY) and Roche (RHHBY), who are also developing Alzheimer's treatments.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** In response, Eli Lilly may accelerate its own product launches or increase R&D spending to enhance its competitive edge in the Alzheimer's market.

- **Customers:** The implications for customers are significant, particularly in terms of access to treatment.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** The inclusion of LEQEMBI in the insurance list will likely increase patient access to early AD treatments, potentially improving outcomes for millions. This could lead to a 20% increase in treatment initiation rates.
  - **Case Studies:** Similar initiatives in other countries have shown that insurance coverage can lead to a substantial increase in patient enrollment in treatment programs, as seen with Biogen's previous drug, Aducanumab.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary

- **Market Reaction:** The market's initial reaction to Eisai's announcement was positive, with shares of Biogen rising by 8% following the news. Analysts noted that the expanded access in China could significantly boost revenues.
- **Analyst Commentary:** A notable quote from a Goldman Sachs analyst stated, "Eisai's strategic move to include LEQEMBI in the innovative drug list is a game-changer for Alzheimer’s treatment in China, positioning them ahead of their competitors."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be assessed through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If LEQEMBI achieves rapid market penetration, shares of Eisai could rise by 20% within a year.
  - **Negative Scenario:** If the drug faces regulatory hurdles or market acceptance issues, shares could decline by 10%, reflecting investor concerns about execution.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids for LEQEMBI is low, given the regulatory complexities in the pharmaceutical industry. However, competitors like Eli Lilly may explore partnerships or acquisitions to bolster their own Alzheimer's portfolios.

#### Similar Deals Likely to Follow
