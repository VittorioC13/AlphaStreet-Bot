#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's future reaction can be evaluated through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If fundraising continues to drive innovation and growth, shares in the Asian markets could rise by 15% over the next year.
  - **Negative Scenario:** Conversely, if geopolitical tensions escalate, shares could decline by 10%, reflecting investor caution.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids in this environment is moderate.
