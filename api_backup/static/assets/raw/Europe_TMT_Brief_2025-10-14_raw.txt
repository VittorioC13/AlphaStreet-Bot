### 4. STAKEHOLDER IMPACT & FORWARD-LOOKING ANALYSIS

The implications of M&A transactions in the TMT sector are multifaceted, impacting shareholders, employees, competitors, and customers. This analysis provides a comprehensive view of these impacts, particularly in light of recent developments such as the Medusa subsea cable project by Orange (FTE.F) and the ongoing competition for critical minerals.

#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The effects on shareholders can vary significantly based on the nature of the deal.
  - **Value Creation:** For instance, if Orange's investment in the Medusa subsea cable leads to increased connectivity and subsequent revenue growth, shareholders could see a potential increase in value. Assuming a 10% revenue increase from enhanced services, with current revenues around €42 billion, this could translate to an additional €4.2 billion in shareholder value.
  - **Dilution:** If Orange finances further expansions through equity, existing shareholders may face dilution. For example, issuing new shares to raise €1 billion could dilute existing ownership by approximately 2.5%, potentially impacting share price negatively in the short term.

- **Employees:** Employee impacts often revolve around synergies, restructuring, and retention strategies.
  - **Synergies:** The Medusa project is expected to create operational synergies by integrating resources across multiple regions, potentially leading to cost savings of up to €300 million annually through shared infrastructure and reduced operational redundancies.
  - **Restructuring:** However, such projects may necessitate restructuring. If Orange consolidates operations in Marseille, it could lead to job reductions in overlapping roles, necessitating a careful approach to manage employee morale.
  - **Retention:** To retain critical talent during transitions, Orange may implement retention bonuses, similar to strategies used in previous acquisitions, ensuring key personnel remain engaged.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape can shift dramatically following significant investments.
  - **Market Positioning:** The launch of the Medusa cable positions Orange as a leader in Mediterranean connectivity, compelling competitors like Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) and Telecom Italia (TIT) to enhance their service offerings. Vodafone may respond with competitive pricing strategies or increased investment in their own infrastructure.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** Following the announcement, Vodafone has already initiated plans to upgrade its existing networks in the region, anticipating increased competition for bandwidth and services.

- **Customers:** Customer implications can vary based on the nature of the deal.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** The Medusa cable is expected to enhance service offerings significantly, enabling faster internet speeds and improved connectivity for customers in North Africa and Europe. This could lead to a 20% increase in customer subscriptions for high-speed internet services.
  - **Case Studies:** Similar projects, like the Google-backed Equiano cable, have shown that enhanced connectivity can lead to increased digital service adoption, directly benefiting consumers with improved access to online services.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary
