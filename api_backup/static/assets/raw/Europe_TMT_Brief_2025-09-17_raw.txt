- **Customers:** Customer implications will largely depend on how the sale affects content and service delivery.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** If the new investors prioritize digital transformation, customers may benefit from improved online platforms and enhanced content delivery.

  - **Positive Scenario:** If the sale leads to strategic investments that enhance growth, shares could rise by 15% within six months.
