- **Retention Strategies**: As Skims grows, retention strategies, such as performance bonuses and career development programs, will be crucial to maintain employee morale and productivity.

@@@ Competitor Impact:
- **Market Positioning**: The funding round for Skims positions it as a formidable player in the apparel market, directly challenging brands like Lululemon (LULU) and Aerie (part of American Eagle Outfitters, AEO). Competitors may need to enhance their product offerings or innovate to maintain market share.
- **Brand Competition**: The split between Steph Curry and Under Armour (UAA) signals a shift in brand dynamics, with Curry poised to launch his independent line, potentially drawing customers away from Under Armour and increasing competition in the athletic apparel space.
