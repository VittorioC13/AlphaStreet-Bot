- **Analyst Commentary:** Analysts have noted the potential for XOMA to enhance its market position significantly. A quote from a Jefferies analyst stated, "This acquisition strengthens XOMA's foothold in the oncology market and could lead to substantial revenue growth in the coming years."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be assessed through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If XOMA successfully integrates Mural and achieves projected synergies, shares could rise by 10% within six months.
  - **Negative Scenario:** If integration challenges arise, shares could decline by 5%, reflecting investor concerns about execution risks.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids in this scenario appears low, as XOMA's acquisition was strategically timed and well-structured. However, if Mural's assets prove more valuable than anticipated, companies like Amgen may consider a competing offer, though regulatory hurdles would complicate this.

#### Similar Deals Likely to Follow
