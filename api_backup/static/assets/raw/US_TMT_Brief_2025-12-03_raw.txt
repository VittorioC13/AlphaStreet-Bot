  - **Case Studies:** Similar transitions have been observed in companies like Western Union (WU), which shifted towards digital solutions, resulting in a 20% increase in customer engagement.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary

- **Market Reaction:** The market's response to Currenc's financial results has been cautious. Following the announcement of a $9.5 million net loss, shares may experience volatility as investors assess the long-term viability of the AI pivot.
- **Analyst Commentary:** Analysts have expressed mixed views. A notable quote from an analyst at Jefferies stated, "While the shift to AI is promising, the immediate financial losses raise concerns about execution risk."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be evaluated through different scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If Currenc successfully integrates AI solutions, shares could rise by 15% within six months, reflecting improved revenue prospects.
  - **Negative Scenario:** If the transition proves challenging, shares could decline by 10%, mirroring investor concerns about operational execution.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers
