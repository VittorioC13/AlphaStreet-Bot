  - **Positive Scenario:** If Lixte effectively utilizes the funds to advance its clinical programs, shares could rise by 15% within a year, reflecting investor confidence in its growth trajectory.
  - **Negative Scenario:** If the market perceives the offering as a sign of financial distress, shares could decline by 10%, indicating investor skepticism.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers
