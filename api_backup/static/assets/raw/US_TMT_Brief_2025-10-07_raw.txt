- **Employees:** The effects on employees often involve synergies, restructuring, and retention strategies.
  - **Synergies:** A merger could lead to operational synergies, potentially saving the company around $2 million annually through streamlined operations and shared resources.
  - **Restructuring:** However, acquisitions often lead to workforce reductions. If Shenandoah decides to consolidate overlapping roles, it may result in layoffs, affecting employee morale and retention.
  - **Retention:** To mitigate turnover, retention bonuses may be offered to key employees. For example, in previous acquisitions, companies have implemented such strategies to ensure critical talent remains during transitions.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape can shift dramatically post-acquisition.

However, other analysts maintain a "buy" rating, suggesting a consensus target price of $26.00, reflecting potential upside.

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be assessed through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If the acquisition leads to successful integration and revenue growth, shares could rise by 20% within six months, reflecting investor confidence.
