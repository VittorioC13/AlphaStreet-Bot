#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The financial maneuvers of Altice International, including the designation of Altice Portugal and Altice Caribbean as unrestricted subsidiaries, could have mixed effects on shareholders.
  - **Value Creation:** By raising €750 million in new debt, Altice aims to stabilize its finances and address its €8.7 billion net liabilities. If successful, this could enhance shareholder value by improving liquidity and operational stability. A scenario where Altice manages to reduce its debt burden effectively could lead to a 15% increase in share price over the next year.
  - **Dilution:** However, if the company continues to struggle and needs to issue more equity to raise funds, existing shareholders may face dilution.
