### 7. Macroeconomic Update

**Key Economic Indicators:**
- **Federal Reserve Policies:** The market anticipates that the Federal Reserve will cut rates multiple times in 2025 and 2026. This is crucial as @@@“our economists are calling for Fed cuts, the market's pricing in Fed cuts.”@ 
- **Mortgage Rate Dynamics:** Despite expected Fed cuts, mortgage rates may not decrease significantly. As noted, @@@“the Fed has already cut rates 100 basis points over the past year, and since the Fed has cut rates 100 basis points in the past year, the mortgage rate is 25 basis points higher.”@
- **Affordability Challenges:** The current effective mortgage rate remains significantly higher than historical averages, with the prevailing rate at over 6.25% compared to an effective rate below 4.25%. This disparity has persisted for over three years, indicating a prolonged affordability crisis.

**Market Trends:**
