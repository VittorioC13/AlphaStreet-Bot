#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The impact on shareholders can be significant, influencing both value creation and dilution.
  - **Value Creation:** In a scenario where Company A (e.g., Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)) acquires Company B (e.g., LinkedIn Corporation (LNKD)), the combined entity could see a revenue increase of approximately 25% due to enhanced integration of LinkedIn's professional network with Microsoft's software ecosystem. Assuming a pre-deal market cap of $1 trillion for Microsoft, a successful integration could increase shareholder value by $250 billion.
  - **Dilution:** If the acquisition is financed through stock, existing shareholders may experience dilution. For instance, if Microsoft issues 5% of its shares to finance the deal, existing shareholders could see their ownership stake decrease, potentially leading to a 3% drop in share price post-announcement.
