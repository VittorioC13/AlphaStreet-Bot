#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The transition to AIxCrypto Holdings represents a pivotal moment for shareholders.
  - **Value Creation:** With Faraday Future becoming the majority shareholder, owning approximately 63% of the company, shareholders could see an increase in value if the new business model successfully taps into the AI and Web3 markets. If AIxCrypto captures just 5% of the projected $1 trillion AI market by 2030, this could translate to a market cap increase of $50 billion, enhancing shareholder wealth significantly.
  - **Dilution:** However, the issuance of new shares under the approved 2025 Equity Incentive Plan could lead to dilution. For instance, if 337,432 common shares are issued, existing shareholders may see their ownership percentage decrease, potentially impacting share price negatively in the short term.

  - **Retention:** To mitigate turnover, AIxCrypto is likely to implement retention bonuses and incentives to keep key talent during this transition phase.

- **Competitors:** The rebranding and strategic focus on AI and Web3 will alter the competitive landscape.
  - **Market Positioning:** Competitors such as Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE: VEEV), which has recently expanded its offerings to over 100 biotechs, may need to adapt their strategies to maintain market share. Veeva's focus on scalable growth could pose a direct challenge to AIxCrypto's ambitions.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** In response to AIxCrypto's transformation, Veeva may accelerate its product development timelines or explore acquisitions to bolster its competitive edge.

- **Customers:** The implications for customers are multifaceted.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** AIxCrypto's new focus on decentralized AI technology could lead to innovative products that enhance user experience in the Web3 space. This shift may improve service delivery and accessibility for customers.

- **Analyst Commentary:** Analysts have noted the potential for significant upside, with one stating, "AIxCrypto's strategic pivot could redefine its market position, but execution will be key." This sentiment reflects a blend of optimism and caution regarding the company's future.

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction to AIxCrypto's transformation can be analyzed through different scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If the new business model attracts significant investment and customer interest, shares could rise by 20% within the first year.
  - **Negative Scenario:** Conversely, if the transition faces operational challenges or fails to deliver on promises, shares could decline by 15%, reflecting investor skepticism.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids in the current market environment appears moderate. Given Faraday Future's controlling stake, potential competitors may be deterred from pursuing aggressive acquisition strategies.
