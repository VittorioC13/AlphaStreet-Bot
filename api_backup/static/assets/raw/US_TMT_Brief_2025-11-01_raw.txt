#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The acquisition is expected to enhance shareholder value through increased market presence and revenue potential.
  - **Value Creation:** Millicom's entry into Ecuador, a dollarized economy with a strong demand for digital services, could lead to an estimated revenue increase of 15% in the first year post-acquisition. Assuming Millicom's current revenue is approximately USD 1.5 billion, this could translate to an additional USD 225 million in revenue.
  - **Dilution:** If financed through equity, existing shareholders might face dilution. For instance, if Millicom issues 5% of its shares to fund the acquisition, existing shareholders could see their ownership stake decrease, potentially leading to a 3% drop in share price post-announcement.

- **Employees:** The acquisition will have varied impacts on employees, including potential synergies and restructuring.
  - **Synergies:** Millicom aims to achieve operational efficiencies by integrating Telefónica's existing workforce and infrastructure, potentially realizing cost savings of USD 50 million annually.
  - **Restructuring:** However, restructuring may lead to job redundancies. Historical precedents, such as Millicom's acquisition of Telefónica Uruguay, resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 10%, indicating a need for careful management of employee transitions.
  - **Retention:** To retain key talent, Millicom may offer retention bonuses, similar to strategies employed in previous acquisitions, ensuring continuity during the integration phase.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape will shift as Millicom strengthens its position in Ecuador.
  - **Market Positioning:** Competitors like Claro and CNT will need to adapt their strategies to counter Millicom's expanded footprint. For example, Claro may respond with enhanced service offerings or competitive pricing to retain market share.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** Following Millicom's acquisition, Claro announced a new promotional campaign aimed at increasing customer retention and expanding its service portfolio in Ecuador.

- **Customers:** The acquisition will likely lead to improved service offerings for customers.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** Millicom's investment in next-generation networks will enhance digital connectivity in Ecuador, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and service reliability.
  - **Case Studies:** Similar to Millicom's integration of Telefónica Uruguay, customers can expect improved access to digital services, which previously resulted in a 20% increase in customer satisfaction ratings.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary

- **Market Reaction:** The market's initial response to the acquisition announcement may be cautious.
  - Analysts predict a slight dip in Millicom's stock price due to concerns over integration challenges, similar to past acquisitions where initial reactions were negative before stabilizing.
- **Analyst Commentary:** A notable quote from a telecommunications analyst stated, "Millicom's strategic move into Ecuador positions it well for future growth, but execution will be key to realizing the anticipated synergies."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be assessed through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If Millicom successfully integrates Telefónica Ecuador and achieves projected synergies, shares could rise by 10% within six months.
  - **Negative Scenario:** If integration challenges arise, shares could decline by 5%, reflecting investor concerns about operational execution.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids in this transaction appears low.
