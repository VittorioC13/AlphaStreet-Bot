### 4. STAKEHOLDER IMPACT & FORWARD-LOOKING ANALYSIS

The ongoing developments in the TMT sector, particularly with the Gulf region's push to become a digital data hub, have significant implications for various stakeholders. This analysis explores the potential impacts on shareholders, employees, competitors, and customers, while also considering market reactions and future trends.

#### Deal-Specific Impacts on Stakeholders

- **Shareholders:** The investments by Qatar and Saudi Arabia in new terrestrial cable systems are poised to create substantial value for shareholders.
  - **Value Creation:** For instance, Ooredoo (IDO1.F) is investing $500 million in fiber optic cable systems that will enhance connectivity from the Arabian Peninsula to Europe. This investment could lead to a projected revenue increase of 15% over the next five years, translating to an estimated $100 million in additional annual revenue.
  - **Dilution:** If Ooredoo finances this expansion through equity, existing shareholders might experience dilution. For example, if Ooredoo issues 10% of its shares to fund the project, existing shareholders could see their ownership stake decrease, potentially leading to a 3% decline in share price post-announcement.

- **Employees:** The expansion of telecommunications infrastructure will have mixed impacts on employees.
  - **Synergies:** The merger of Qatar National Broadband Network (QNBN) and Gulf Bridge International (GBI) aims to create a carrier-neutral digital infrastructure leader. This consolidation is expected to generate operational synergies of approximately $50 million annually through cost reductions and improved service offerings.
  - **Restructuring:** However, such mergers often lead to job redundancies. The QNBN-GBI merger may result in a reduction of 1,000 positions, necessitating careful planning to retain critical talent.
  - **Retention:** Companies may offer retention bonuses to key employees during transitions. For instance, Ooredoo could implement retention packages for its top engineers to ensure continuity in project execution.

- **Competitors:** The competitive landscape will shift as Gulf nations enhance their digital infrastructure.
  - **Market Positioning:** As Ooredoo and its competitors invest in new cable systems, companies like Etisalat (ETISALAT) and STC (Saudi Telecom Company) will need to adapt their strategies to maintain market share. This could involve increasing their own investments in infrastructure or enhancing service offerings.
  - **Specific Competitor Moves:** For example, Etisalat has recently announced a $1 billion investment in expanding its 5G network, directly responding to the competitive pressure from Ooredoo's initiatives.

- **Customers:** The implications for customers are significant, particularly in terms of service quality and availability.
  - **Product/Service Implications:** The new cable systems will improve internet speeds and reliability for consumers in the region. Enhanced connectivity could lead to a 20% increase in customer satisfaction ratings for Ooredoo.
  - **Case Studies:** Similar expansions, such as the deployment of Google Fiber in the U.S., have shown that improved infrastructure can lead to a 30% increase in customer acquisition rates due to better service offerings.

#### Market Reaction and Analyst Commentary

- **Market Reaction:** The market's response to these developments is likely to be positive, reflecting investor confidence in the growth potential of the Gulf region's digital economy.
  - Analysts project that Ooredoo's stock could rise by 10% within six months of the announcement, driven by anticipated revenue growth from new infrastructure.
- **Analyst Commentary:** A recent quote from a telecommunications analyst noted, "The Gulf's investment in digital infrastructure is a game changer, positioning the region as a global data hub and enhancing the competitive landscape."

#### Expected Market Reaction and Scenario Analysis

- **Scenario Analysis:** The market's reaction can be assessed through various scenarios:
  - **Positive Scenario:** If Ooredoo successfully integrates its new cable systems and achieves projected revenue growth, shares could rise by 15% within a year.
  - **Negative Scenario:** If integration challenges arise or if the market reacts negatively to dilution, shares could decline by 5%.

#### Potential Counter-Bids or Competing Offers

- **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of counter-bids in this sector is moderate.
  - For instance, if Ooredoo's expansion proves successful, competitors like STC may consider counter-offers to acquire smaller regional players to enhance their own infrastructure capabilities.
